A mirror of Dan Acree's Motorcycle Repair Course (http://www.dansmc.com/mc_repaircourse.htm)

Dan Acree has been a motorcycle mechanic since 1967.  In 1999 he started Dan's Motorcycle Repair Course at http://www.icehouse.net/dansmc.  A few years later he moved it to http://www.dansmc.com.  Over the years it has grown into one of the largest and best resources on the internet for those who want to learn motorcycle repair.  Because he's been around for a long time it has invaluable information on points ignition systems and other repair tips from pre-1990s bikes.  With that becoming a lost art as more old school mechanics retire I feel it is important to make sure this is archived for all to enjoy and learn from.

Dan retired in 2023 and has been inactive ever since.
