<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!

<center><H2>April 25, 2011</H2></center>

<P>So let me get this straight. You can put a cross, the main symbol of the Christian religion, in a jar of urine, call it "PissChrist" and that is "Free Speech". However, if you burn a Koran in the USA and Islamic kooks in afghanistan kill people over it, even our Army Generals call the burning "Intolerance" which endangers our troops. Of course you have to remember that Christians will not kill you over this. The same cannot be said of our sweet, peace loving, Moslem brothers. Sorry to offend but the truth sometimes hurts, doesn't it? Oh yes, It is also OK to kill some one who changes their religion from Islam to ??? If you think that is intolerance, well, you just don't understand.

<P>Perhaps this might be a good time to revisit a question that one reader asked me several years ago. He asked if I still thought the Iraq invasion was a good thing. I answered yes. Do I still think that? Well, you decide. 

<P>The news just carried a story of a new mass grave found in Iraq from Saddam's era. I imagine they will continue to find more mass graves as time passes. The toppling and execution of Saddam Hussein was one of the Great Justices taking place in this world. It could not have happened to a more deserving guy. The war worked great. The peace, not so much.

<P>Many times it is asked, as an example, "If you saw a woman being hurt and beaten wouldn't you run out and help her?" My answer would be yes. The only trouble is that that question does not go far enough. The real question is "Would you help this woman and then take her into your home, with her six children?" Actually there are only four, two are in juvie for stealing cars and selling dope. She refuses to get a job or do any work around your house. Also, while living in your house she keeps hooking and refuses to give up her drug habit. Her children get in fights and trouble at school every day too.

<P>To top it all off she continues to sneak out and see the man, who was her common law husband, who was beating her. "He's really a good man" she says, "You just don't understand."

<P>That is where we are at in Iraq and Afghanistan. They both hate the USA. Some News poll said that most Afghan people have no idea why we are there in their country. 

<P>I still believe we should help that beaten woman. I still believe it is better to fight enemies over there instead of over here. I just have to ask... How long do we have to help? We will not discuss Libya at this time. I'm sure our Nobel Peace Prize winning President will handle Muammar with the same skill he used with the economy. Yeah, sure, right, whatever.

<P>Consider something else. We are flat stinking broke. We have no money to pay for our own obligations let alone anyone else's. I have always thought the isolationist policies of  politicos Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul where a bit over the top but that was when we still had money. Thanks to President Obama's wild spending we are broke. Maybe it is time to change course.

<P>Sooooo... What do you think about all this?

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!

<P>One last thing. This is for comments on my Blobs only. No motorcycle questions because I'm not writing back from this E-Mail address. OK? 

<P>If you have motorcycle questions click the motorcycle <a href="emailtome.htm"><img src="cr125r.gif" width=50 height=30 border=0></A> and follow my rules.
