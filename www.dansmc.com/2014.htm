<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!
</Center>

<center><H1>2014</H1></center>



<P>OK, it's 2014 and I just saw a poll that said 30% the pubic don't know what the Affordable Care Act is and 12% didn't know what Obamacare was. (Both are the same thing) A Harris Poll in 2005 found that 22% of respondents thought the three branches of government were "Republican, Democrat and Independent." (Judicial, Legislative, Executive). I find this amazing but quite believable. I confess I have sort of lost hope that our great country can recover from all the wonderfulness President Obama and the Democratic progressives have brought us, and yes, you are right, the Republican "Leadership" has a big hand in this too. Republicans Mr. MacCain and Mr. Romney were just New <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke" target="_blank">Coke</A> to the Democrats Pepsi. I tried New Coke when it first cam out. It tasted like watered down Pepsi and I purely hate Pepsi. 

<P>But all is not really lost yet. A lot depends on you not getting fooled this time around. When Mr. Obama was elected he did everything wrong, just like I expected him to. How did I do that? Well, it seems pretty obvious to me... President Obama and the rest of the Democrats Lied. As in lier, lier, pants on fire. You didn't see it coming? How did you miss it? Then you voted for him again? Didn't you notice how bad the economy is? 30 hour work week and part time work is a recovery? What is wrong with you people?

<P>Well, I think I might have figured out the why and the good new is, <B>THERE IS A CURE.</B> Bear with me and I will tell you what it is and it will work for anyone. Even if you are a scum sucking Liberal/Conservative/Libertarian/whoever/whatever (pick one), you can still use this information to pick the correct path to succeed and achieve whatever goal you have set for yourself.

<P>I just finished reading an autobiography by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer" target="_blank">Albert Speer.</A> Speer was an architect in Germany in the early 1930s. He went on to become Hitler's personal architect and eventually became the Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich. He did not start out bad but sure ended up that way. 1st Corinthians 15:33 tells us <B>"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."</B> After World War Two Speer spent twenty years in prison. He wrote his book during and after his incarceration. In his book he claims he did not know about the conditions of the slave workers that were used in his factories. He claims he did not know about the extermination camps and all the other atrocities that Hitler's regime committed. He then states that there is no reason for him not knowing except for the fact that he <B>CHOSE</B> not to know.

<P>It is said that Human Beings have the unique ability to believe only what we want to believe, regardless of the facts. I believe they call that <A href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rationalization" target="_blank">rationalzation</A>. Yes, we are rational beings, we can always find a good reason to believe exactly what we want to believe. Often, that is the easiest way and we, like electricity, always take the easiest way out. The easiest way is often not the best way. That little gift, or flaw if you will, is what causes all the problems.

<P>Let's face, it we all have better things to do then to waste time figuring all this stuff out. I mean really, which would you rather do? Study or or go out with freinds and party? Politicians from both parties use this to keep themselves in office. They pick things that sound good (You can keep your health care insurance, you can keep your Doctor) but are complete lies so you will not look any further into whatever they are selling until it is too late. So the first thing we need to do is wake up and realize what is being done to us. We need to <B>CHOOSE</B> to know. If we are going to keep our Freedoms and our freedom of choice we need to wake up and see what is being done to us. If we take the easy way out these politicians from <B>BOTH</B> parties will strip us of all our freedoms.

<P>So, we want to make the choice to start seeing all the shenanigans these people are pulling on us. So how do we do that? I mean really. They did not cover that in school, did they? Well, unfortunately, in many High Schools and Collages they do not, but not all. I had an English Professor who taught critical thinking. His policy was this. You could say anything you want but you had to be able to show some kind of proof for what you think. If you start to practice this you will see through most of the Horse Pucky the present batch of politicians are trying to feed us. There has to be some kind of proof for what you think.

<P>But how do we do that? When people lie to me I get really, really mad at them. When they lie to you, you need to get really, really mad too. So how do we do this? How do we find the truth? 

<P>First of all we need to examine the evidence. Facts or evidence come in a number of ways.
<OL>
<LI>Empirical. Evidence that is repeatable.
<LI>Eye Witness. You saw it.
<LI>Probability. What are the odds?
<LI>Historical. What has happened in the past.
<LI>Legal. Will it hold up in a court of law.
</OL> 

<P>If we take what we hear and see and decide what type of fact evidence it is supposed to be, it will help us determine whether we should believe it or not. The amount of stuff people believe to be true, which is not true is truly astonishing. I believe that is because people just do not bother to think about it. They accept it at face value and do not bother to check the facts. When someone lies to you, it is a wise policy to not believe them again. At least not till they have a change of heart and prove themselves to be truthful. When I see repeated lies I stop listening to that sourse of information.

<P>I'll give you an example. I really like the way the News program "60 Minutes" presents the stories they cover. Then I saw one of their expos'es about horrible, horrible, bear poachers. They were selling bear heads. Had several in a row. Just the heads, nothing else. Those heads were worthless without the rest of the bear skin. Oh yes, and bear gall bladders. Worth thousands, supposedly. Well folks, I sell bear parts all the time and I do it legally. In the state of Idaho I can LEGALLY sell you a Bear Gall. I don't have any at present because they are worth NOTHING right now. Even when they were worth something they weren't worth much, maybe $150.00 tops. Thousands of dollars? No, I don't think so.

<h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS TO ME<BR></H1></center>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
