Tools. You have to have lots of tools to work on motorcycles. So what does that mean? Do you have to go out and buy 
a $2000 master tool set to do good work? No, not at all. A basic tool kit is all you need. You can add tools as you need them. 
It's always nice to have pretty, shiny, new tools, but hey, the bolts don't care. They'll come apart with old tools, same as new. 
Start looking around... garage sales, 2nd hand stores...tell your friends you're looking for some tools. Most mechanics start out with 
old, junky tools and upgrade as money allows. This means there are lots of old tools floating around. Maybe they will sell cheap or even 
give them to you, so keep your eyes open for them.

<P>If you are really new to tools, a good place to learn about what is out there is a tool catalog. Sears Craftsman tools put out a free one that is a 
good place to start. Almost all my tools are Craftsman. There is a good reason for that...they are guaranteed forever (well, maybe just till 
they go out of business.) If I break one, I just take it back to Sears, and they give me a new one. I've fished them out of dumpsters, bought 
broken ones from junk yards and take them back and I get a new one. There are others who give a lifetime warrenty, but I always know where a 
Sears is. I don't always know where the other guys are. 

<P><U><B>UPDATE:</B></U> Sears seems to be slowly dying but you can still get Craftsman tools and replacements from Ace Hardware and Lowes.

<P>To start with you're going to need some wrenches. Wrenches come in lots of types 
and sizes.<a href="tools_wrenches.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_wrenchesa.jpg" alt="Wrenches" align=left height=176 width=150></a> The handiest ones are Combination Wrenches. You will need sizes 6mm through 14mm, 17mm and 19mm to start. Two sets are nice, one for 
the nut and one for the bolt head. A set of small, open end ignition wrenches is handy. Especially if the bike you are working on has points. 
A set of inch (US) wrenches would be good too.

<P><a href="tools_screwdrivers.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_screwdriversa.jpg" alt="Screw Drivers" align=right height=158 width=150></a>
You will need lots of Screw Drivers. Small ones, large ones, big, long ones, small,short ones, short big ones and long small ones. 
Well, you get the idea. There are all kinds of weird screw heads. Besides the ones we all know, Straight and Phillips, there are Allen, Torex, Square 
and others. You will also use them for all kinds of unauthorized prying, chisling, levering and such. As Red Green says " Any tool can be the right tool."

<P><a href="tools_impactdriver.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_impactdrivera.jpg" alt="Impact Driver" align=left height=146 width=150></a>
The Impact Driver is a must have tool. The steel Phillips head screws used on a large number of motorcycles really lock onto the threads in the 
aluminum crankcases. You must have an Impact Driver to get them out. Impact Drivers come in both 3/8" and 1/2" drives. You can use screw driver bits 
or sockets with them. To use an impact driver first select the right size of bit, then put it on the driver and onto the screw. Turn the body of the 
driver in the direction you want to turn. This " cocks " the tool, so to speak. Now hit it on the end, with a hammer, good and hard, and off it comes...
the screw, that is. Remember to back up the part. If the part with the screw in it is not strong enough to take the hammer blow, it will break. 

<P><a href="tools_sockets.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_socketsa.jpg" alt="Sockets" align=right height=60 width=150></a>
Sockets come in 6, 8, and 12 points and 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", and bigger drives. The points refer to the way the socket grips the bolt or nut. 
6 and 12 point work on hex head bolts and nuts. The 6 point has a very strong grip on the hex head. the 12 point has a weaker grip 
<a href="tools_socketdrives.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_socketdrivesa.jpg" alt="Socket Drives" align=left height=64 width=150></a>but allows the 
socket to go on the bolt easier. I always try to get 6 point sockets. I don't think the 12 point are that useful. The drive refers to the 
square that is used to drive the socket. 8 point sockets are used on the square nuts seen on farm machinery. You will need sockets in the 
same sizes as your wrenches. Sockets below 10mm will use 1/4" drive handles. 3/8" drive goes from 10mm up to 19mm. 1/2" drive goes from 10mm 
on up to 36mm or so. 3/8" seems to be the drive to use for most bike work.

<P><a href="tools_sockethandles.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_sockethandlesa.jpg" alt="Socket handles" align=right height=93 width=150></a>
The handles for these sockets come in all kinds of shapes, sizes, and styles. T-Handles are handy, as are rachet handles. Just pick the ones you like.
<a href="tools_socketextensions.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_socketextensionsa.jpg" alt="Socket Extensions" align=left width=150 height=65></a>
Socket extensions come in all sizes from 1 1/2" long on up. Get several. You can hook them together to get any length extension you want.

<P><a href="tools_pliers.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_pliersa.jpg" alt="Pliers" align=right width=150 height=155></A>Pliers are useful for holding things tightly. They come in lots of shapes and sizes. Vice-Grip types are very useful. If you only have one make it a medium sized Vice-Grip. Better yet, get a whole bunch of them, you will use them.

<P><a href="tools_crescentwrench.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_crescentwrencha.jpg" alt="Crescent Wrenches" align=left height=87 width=150></a>
No good mechanic ever uses a Crescent Wrench...but we all have a good selection of them hidden in our tool box! Now you would think that with as many 
tools as I have, I would always have exactly the right wench for every nut and bolt. But, you would be wrong. I am always running across 
bolts that nothing fits. For those bolts, I keep the trusty Crescent Wrench. So tell everyone you never use a Crescent Wrench and keep a good supply of them.

<P><a href="tools_wrench_referance.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tools_wrench_referancea.jpg" alt="Wrench Size Referance" align=right width=200 height=487></a>
If it's a British bike like Triumph, BSA, Norton and the like, it will have nuts and bolts that are British Standard. These are also called Whitworth. You will need a set of these Wrenches if you work on British stuff. 
Speaking about funny sized bolts, from time to time you will run across bolts and nuts that are rounded off or it's a weird size. If you measure the 
bolt and compare it with this chart, you will be able to select a socket or wrench that is pretty close in size. Print it out on card stock, laminate it and put it in your toolbox. My thanks to Flanders Co., a motorcycle parts distributor, for giving me permission to reprint this chart from their catalog.

<P>There are lots of other tools out there and the ones you will want will depend on the job you are doing. If you are just starting your tool box, here is what I would consider a good start.

<P>
<LI>A good hammer
<LI>Impact Driver and Bits
<LI>Set of 6-point, meteric sockets, 6mm-19mm, 
<LI>Set of 6-point, inch sockets, 5/32"-7/8",

<BR><BR> The list is endless, but at least now you have a place to start.
<P>Someone requested an easy way to print out the wrench referance.  Here it is<a href="wrench_referance.pdf"><img src="pdf_logo.gif" height=32 width=32 border=0></a>, a bit small but printable. Remember to right click and left click "Save Target <U>As</U>..."</P> <BR><BR>
