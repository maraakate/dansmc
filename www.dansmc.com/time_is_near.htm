<div align="center"><h1>The Time Is Near</h1></div><BR>

<font size=4><P>I woke up this morning with the clear remembrance of a dream I had last night. I was to put this message up as a web page on my site. So here it is! Jesus is coming and the time is getting near. 
<P><B>"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up." 2nd Peter 3:10</b>
<P> You must be ready. 

<P><B>"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh." Matthew 24:42-44</B>

<P>Monumentous things are happening in our times. 3,000 people went to work on September eleventh, just like any other day. They had plans for the future. That future was stolen from them by a few evil people, filled with hate. Now out of nowhere, we have thousands dying from the Wuhan Virus. Were they ready to meet God? Are you? I know I am. 

<P>In John 14:6 <B>"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."</B>
God loves you and He sent His son to die in your place, to save you from the penalty of your sin.


<P><B>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16</B>

<P> We only have to do one thing. Believe in Jesus, and place our trust in Him and His finished work on the cross. He did it all for us. We are sinners, all of us. None of us is good enough to make it to Heaven on our own merits or good works.

<P><B>"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one." Romans 3:10</B>

<P>There is one and only one way to be saved. One way, NOT many ways, NOT many paths, ONE way and only ONE way.

<P><B>"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." Acts 16:30-31</B>

<P> Time is getting short. You must start thinking about this. I'm not sure if any of the 3,000 people killed on 9-11 were ready to die. I am sure that none of them thought that that day would be their last on earth.

<BR><BR><center><B> Is today my last day? <BR>Is it yours? <BR>Think about it.</B></center>
