<P><font size=4>LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE, Va. (ACCNS) � A graphic artist here designed the artwork that is decorating Air Force aircraft everywhere to honor the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

<P>Air Combat Command�s multimedia center was given the job of designing a special piece of aircraft nose art, explained Jay Welsh, chief of visual communication.

<P>Welsh challenged his staff to come up with a series of designs that would capture the spirit of the country on Sept. 11.



<P>Seven or eight designs were submitted. �They were all terrific,� Welsh said. �We narrowed it down to four selections and then sent them up to Gen. [John] Jumper.�

<P>The Air Force chief of staff selected Senior Airman Duane White�s design.

<P>�I used the image of the American bald eagle swooping down to symbolize action and power,� White said. �The American flag in the background represents those who are proud to defend and die for their freedom as Americans.�

<P>White�s design will be on aircraft around the world. The Thunderbirds and other Air Force demonstration teams will also apply this nose art on their aircraft. Major commands and wings are authorized to apply the design to one aircraft each.

<P>�I feel honored to be able to pay my respect to those who lost their lives Sept. 11 by contributing a graphic that symbolizes American�s courage in the worst of times,� White said.

<P>The words �Let�s roll!� used in the design, were made famous by Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer. He was overheard, on a cellular phone, saying, �Let�s roll!� as passengers charged the terrorists just before the flight crashed in a field in western Pennsylvania.</font>
