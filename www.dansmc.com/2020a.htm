<P> So you need to:
<OL><B>
<LI> Always maintain six feet of distance to everyone. 
<P>
<LI> Use hand sanitizer and wash your hands a lot. 20 seconds or more, use lots of soap.
<P>
<LI> Don't touch your face or eyes or ears or nose or mouth. You get the Idea?
</B></OL>

<P>Do those things and your chance of catching the Wuhan virus drops to one chance in a hundred.
<BR><BR>

You could wear a mask too. I saw an interview with a Doctor last night. He said that New York had about over 2300 Wuhan Virus deaths out of 10 million people but Japan had about 63 deaths with 124 million people. All the Japanese wear masks. Yet our health people say don't wear a mask. I think maybe we should wear masks. If you do not have one and can't get one, you can make one. Here are some <a href="facemaskinstructionsCOVID-19.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</A> to do just that! Here is a PDF on<a href="face_mask_2013.pdf" target="_blank"> Face Mask effectiveness.</A>

<P>You know, riding a Motorcycle meets all these criteria, Right?

<P>Anyway, President Trump wanted to pass a relief package for the people. True to form the democRATS try to pushed their hate America agenda. So now we have a $2 Trillion dollar spending bill. The single biggest recipient of taxpayer dollars, with $600 billion, is government itself.

<UL>
<LI>$75M to the National Foundation on the Arts & Humanities 
<LI>$78K to the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development 
<LI>$500K to a Utah water project
<LI>$25B for more food stamps and child nutrition
<LI>$12B housing
<LI>$3.5B to states for childcare 
<LI>$32B for education 
<LI>$900M for low-income heating assistance
<LI>$50M for legal services for the poor
<LI>$37M for the U.S. Forest Service
<LI>$25 million  for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
</UL>
<P>and on and on.

<P>Ah yes, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. "The Washington, D.C. group sent an email to musicians in the National Symphony Orchestra saying their checks would be cut off starting April 3, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed to provide the money to the Kennedy Center as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill President Donald Trump signed Friday."

<P> "The Covid-19 Advisory Committee was broadsided today during our conversation with [Kennedy Center President] Deborah Rutter," the email reads. "Ms. Rutter abruptly informed us today that the last paycheck for all musicians and librarians will be April 3 and that we will not be paid again until the Center reopens." <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-kennedy-center-musicians-bailout/" target="_blank">Daily Caller</A>

"Everyone should proceed as if their last paycheck will be April 3," it continued. "We understand this will come [as a] shock to all of you, as it did to us."



<P>It was supposed to help US workers make it through the next few months but Pelosi lied again. Supposedly $350 billion went to US workers. Plus $600 Billion for the Government... I wonder where the rest of it went?

<P>I just ran across this from Hulk Hogan today (April 8th).

<P>66-year-old Hulk Hogan wrote, "Word up, can you handle the truth my 
brother only love HH in three short months, just like He did with the 
plagues of Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship."

<P>"God 
said, 'You want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You 
want to worship musicians, I will shut down civic centers. You want to 
worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I 
will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don't want
 to go to church and worship me, I will make it where you can't go to a 
church,


<P>"Maybe we don't need a vaccine. Maybe we need to take 
this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a 
personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that 
really matters. Jesus."

<P>He is right! 2nd Chronicles 7:13-14 states:

<P><b>"If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."</b>

<p>We all need to do this, are you hearing me everyone? That includes me.


<P>I'll add more when I get more, however, in the final analysis, it would do us well to remember what was said to a jailer over 2000 years ago. 

<center><font size=5><B>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved."</B></font></center>
<BR><center><Img src="bar70.gif" height=25 width=700></center>

<P><font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> Ok, here we go. Back to the silly season. I really like to hear each political view and then consider each view. This time it is really hard to do this. 

<P><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/director-of-taxpayer-funded-museum-i-hope-every-single-one-of-you-pieces-of-st-that-votes-republican-dies-today?utm_source=theblaze-dailyAM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily-Newsletter__AM%202020-03-07&utm_term=TheBlaze%20Daily%20AM%20-%20last%20270%20days" target="_blank">Melonnie Hicks</A>, executive director of the Pioneer City County Museum in Sweetwater, wrote "I hope every single one of you pieces of s**t that votes Republican dies today." So let me get this straight. You want me dead if I vote Republican. That does not sound very loving or inclusive, does it?



<P>Senator Chuck Schumer Threatened two Supreme Court Justices if they voted against the right of a woman to kill her own baby. 

<P>Rich old man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvxUMv76aPY&t=39s
" target="_blank"><strike>Bloomberg</strike></A> wants old people to die and get out of the way. 

<P>The progressive democRATS are just, well, loony. Sixty to one hundred trillion increase in government spending? That is what Bolshevik Bernie wants to spend. Free everything. So does <strike>Lieawatha</strike> and all the rest.

<P><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woD0N-vOsMs" target="_blank">Sleepy Joe</a>, if he can stay awake, is not much better. 62 trillion for Free Tuition, Free Health Care, Open Boarders. No more 2nd Amendment which, of course, means no more 1st Amendment. If you are so stupid as to believe boys are boys and girls are girls and that one can't really become the other... well, we have re-education camps for you. Hey, It worked Joe Stalin and the Chinese!

<P>The democRATS keep talking about Love and Inclusion and Diversity. So that is why they keep changing the parties debate rules. So old, white men can debate and not get confused by young white women who might want to be included? Now the RATS may put up Governor Andrew Como? 

<P>On Apr. 1, 2020  Thomas Gallatin  on <a href="https://patriotpost.us/articles/69625-cuomos-fateful-decision-2020-04-01" target="_blank"> Patriot Post</A> pointed out:

<P>"In 2015, New York's Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo was faced with a decision: purchase a recommended 16,000 ventilators to add to the state's pandemic preparation stockpile, or spend the millions elsewhere. Cuomo chose to go the latter route, commissioning a task force led by his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, to come up with a rationing plan for using the state's existing ventilators should a pandemic scenario ever become reality. In other words, <B>create a death panel that will determine who gets the state's limited number of ventilators.</B>

<P>Furthermore, instead of spending $576 million on 16,000 ventilators, Cuomo elected to waste $750 million of the state's budget on a solar-panel boondoggle known as the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/13/cuomos-buffalo-billion-was-beyond-corrupt/" target="_blank">Buffalo Billion.</A>

<P>Now, five short years later, that unthinkable pandemic is here and New York, the state hardest hit by the China Virus, has been caught unprepared. Cuomo daily begs the federal government for more ventilators as if it was the job of the federal government to ensure that states were fully prepared for whatever crisis may come along." 

<P>Do you really want this myopic loser to run for President?

<P>Why vote? Our progressive betters will pick a candidate for us. Can you say "Yes Master"? But never fear, they can always turn to Hillary Clinton to save us. It could be a <a href="twofer.gif" target="_blank">twofer</a> with her "I-did-not-have-sex-with-that-woman" husband.

<P>What am I to do? I will never give up my Constitutional Rights. I will never agree with murdering babes. I will never give up my Citizenship to thieves sneaking over the boarder and I don't want to give up my health to the diseases they bring with them. Can you say Wuhan Virus? So how, exactly, do we come together?

<P>
OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
