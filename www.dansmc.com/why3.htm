<font size=4>A new year and some new E-Mail.
<HR color=red>

<P>Hello Dan,
 
<P>As a biker for over more than 30 years, I would like to congratulate you with and to thank you for your excellent site.
I found a lot of interesting stuff and information on it and already sent it through to some fellow bikers.
 
<P>I believe, that essentially you are good man and a Christian, proved by your helpfull attitude toward everybody by visiting and reading your site. Also I can understand your support for your  country and his armed forces, but not your support for the actual president and the Iraqi war. 
Maybe this is due to the lack of adequate information on what is really going on in the rest of the world and the way your governement is handling it, with the help of doubtfull broadcast stations as CNN, Fox and others.
 
<P>You, the American people are all victims of a deformed or no-information about the essentials of what is going on in the world. We, Europeans don't blame the American people, but only their leaders who are misusing you for their own profits. And we are afraid of the agressive speeches of violence and terror and the arrogant behaviour towards other peoples and cultures
of your leader and his entourage. Therefore you people now live in fear, dominated by rules like a patriotic act due only to the desire for power and glory of your leaders. 
 
<P>You, as a Christian will know for shure the Bible expression : "Who, who wants to rule by the sword, will be killed by the sword".
 
<P>This for short, with all respect to you,
 
<P>regards,
 
<P>Mich

<P>Hi Mitch,
 
<P>Thank you for your letter. I guess I just don't understand. Over the last decade I've watched France and Germany and the leaders at the UN steal food from the Iraqi people yet you are not mad at them. I've watched Saddam kill hundreds of thousands of people, yet you are not mad at him. I've watched the Taliban in Afghanistan kill tens of thousands, yet you are not mad at them either. 
 
<P>It would seem it is the Europeans that are  "victims of a deformed or no-information about the essentials of what is going on in the world." If our leaders have this desire for power and profits, why are we rebuilding Iraqi and Afghanistan and giving them freedom and to top it off we are paying a pretty penny for the privilege of doing it. Do you really think Syria would have pulled it's troops out of Lebanon, freeing the Lebanese people, if we were not right next door ? Freedom is an intoxicating beverage. Once the oppressed peoples of the world drink of it, thieves and dictators had better watch out !
 
<P>One question though, CNN is totally against the Iraqi war. Most US news organizations and news papers, with the exception of FOX, put a very biased, anti war slant on their reporting. Where did you get the idea that they support it ? 
 
<P>Well, we probably will not end up agreeing on this, but it is good to hear your thoughts on the matter.
 
<P>One last thing. You mentioned the words of Jesus but you took them a bit out of context. 
<P>Mat 26:52 "Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

<P>Mat 26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

<P>Mat 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

<P>Mat 26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

<P>Mat 26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." 

<P>Jesus was fulfilling the scriptures. He died to take away the sin of the world. He died to save Saddam. He died to save me and he died to save you too. All we have to do is believe on Jesus and his finished work on the cross. Once we do that, a lot of the problems of this world will not seem so bad.

<P>Thank you for your thoughts,

<P>Dan

<P>Now, I would like to ask a few questions to those who keep thinking the American people are "Miss informed".

Why do you keep saying we are getting all our pro Iraqi war information from CNN and the Newspapers ? CNN, our local newspapers and all the national TV stations (ABC,CBS,NBC) are solidly anti Iraqi war. Americans get their information from a lot of different sources.
