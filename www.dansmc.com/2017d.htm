<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4 face=tahoma> Well, here we are. I was hoping we might be finally coming together. However, the progressive Democrats and the alphabet news have raised hate to new heights while calling it Peace and Love. 

<P>Obama Care is imploding yet the Democ rats <img class="expando cat" border="0" src="oops_typo_2_150.jpg" width="25" height="16"> will not join us in putting into law something better. <BR>

<P>The Republicans told us "Give us the House and we will fix it". We did and nothing was done. They said "Got to have the Senate too". We gave it to them and nothing was done. "So sorry, we need the Presidency too, then things will really get done". Seven years to make a really good Health Care Law and guess what? Nothing gets done. Why?

<P>Did you ever hear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke" target="_blank">New Coke?</a> I sure did. In 1985 the Coca-Cola company tried to replace the soft drink "Coke" with "New Coke". I like Coke so I tried the New Coke. It tasted just like watered down Pepsi and Pepsi tastes like gutter water. It least to me it does. It went nowhere because if you like the Pepsi taste watered down , well just water down your Pepsi. If you don't like Pepsi, the watered down version makes you want to puke.

<P>That describes the present day Republican establishment leadership. They act like watered down, wimpy, Democrats only we do not describe them as New Republicans. We call them RINOs. Republicans In Name Only. I had no idea that there were as many hidden RINOs as they are. I always thought the reason the Republicans never got anything done was because the just did not have enough legislative power. Now that they do have the power we find out that the Republican Establishment is really "New Coke" or rather RINO.

<P>Wow, they sure fooled me. McCain, McConnell, Bush, Ryan, and all the establishment Republican leaders, all RINOs. I say again WOW! So that is why nothing is getting done.

<P>Well, maybe the we didn't get fooled totally. All the establishment people in power, the RINOs, the Demo rats, the alphabet news, they just could not believe we, the people, would pick Donald Trump as our president. What's that you say? Trump didn't win the popular vote? They are now finding that in liberal states,  like California, there may have been <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/19/noncitizen-illegal-vote-number-higher-than-estimat/" target="_blank">millions</A> of illegal voters in total.

<P>The reason Donald Trump was elected President is because all the rest of our so-called leaders have refused to do the job they were elected to do. They are selling our citizenship to Illegal Aliens foe votes to keep themselves in office and on the government gravy train. They use our tax dollars to buy votes with Free Food, Free Smart Phones, Free Everything to keep themselves in office raking in all the perks and honors of Public Office. I mean really, it's working so well for the politicians in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/11/news/economy/venezuela-food-shortages/index.html" target="_blank">Venezuela</A>. Unfortunately, it is not working for the people of Venezuela.


<P>President Trump is a Diamond in the rough. Does he sometimes go off half cocked? Yes. Does he Tweet outrageous stuff? Yes. Will he honestly work hard for the betterment of ALL the American People? Yes. Are there other well trained and experienced politicians who could do a better job... if they wanted to? Yes. Are these politicians doing a better job? <font size=5><B><U>NO!</U></b></font> Are they even trying? <font size=5><B><U>NO!</U></b></font>

<P>Thousands of years ago the Jewish State was in turmoil. Enemies on all sides, fightings within, every day a new problem. All of this was because of sin in the camp. The Jewish people turned back to God but who would lead them? The men who should have been leading chose not to lead. So a woman named Debra, stepped up to the plate and Judged Israel for God when other, seemingly better leaders, would not do the job.

<P>When he has to, God will use flawed, but willing, people to do his will when the natural and proper leaders refuse to be used. In Luke 19:39 and 40 Jesus said,

<P><B>"And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
 And he answered and said unto them,<font color=red> I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</B></font>"<font size=4 face=tahoma>

<P>Do you really think Jesus wanted to use stones to tell you about himself? No, he is simply saying that if he has to, he will use even flawed stones to do his will, if necessary.

<P>I believe that President Trump, is one of these flawed stones. If he holds true to his course, with God's help, he will lead America back to economic and moral greatness. We can make America to be Great Again. I urge all Americans to follow President Trump's lead. Reject all the RINO, DINO and alphabet news lies. <a href="http://dansmc.com/info.htm" target="_blank">Search</A> out the truth for yourself. Know the truth and the truth will set you free. As Jesus said in John 8:28-32

<P>"Then said Jesus unto them, <font color=red>When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</font> As he spake these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <font color=red> If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</font>"

<P>If we continue to believe the lies of the Establishment political leaders on both sides we will either slowly go the way of New Coke which disappeared in 2002 or burn like Venezuela is burning today.

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
