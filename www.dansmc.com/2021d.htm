<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> Well, here we are. The fraudster-in-chief is pushing for more spending, less accountability, more lies. Things that hurt our country. Just like there are cultural mores that help a nation's people grow and prosper, there are mores that hurt a nation's people.

<P>We have covered <a href="2021c.htm" target="_blank">God's mores</A> now lets covers Man's mores.

<lu>
<LI> A <B><U>dis</U></B>belief in Jesus.
<LI> A <B><U>dis</U></B>belief in Capitalism.
<LI> A <B><U>dis</U></B>belief in work.
<LI> A belief in Abortion. Abortion is the flat out <a href="abortion.htm" target="_blank">murder of millions</A> of inconvenient people.
<LI> A belief that lying, to benefit ourselves or beliefs is OK.
<LI> A belief breaking the law is OK.
<LI> A belief that Homosexuality is OK.
<LI> A belief that Sex outside of marriage is OK.
<LI> A belief that there are more than two (Male & Female) sexes. We all start out as <BR>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp<a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/transfeminist-activist-says-gendering-animals-is-very-wrong-and-social-media-erupts-with-ridicule?utm_source=theblaze-dailyPM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily-Newsletter__PM%202021-06-26&utm_term=ACTIVE%20LIST%20-%20TheBlaze%20Daily%20PM" target="_blank">"non-arboreal carbon-based multicellular agents."</A>
<LI> A belief that you can spend everything you make without saving for the future.
<LI> A belief that you don't have to keep your word as long as you really meant to, but it just didn't work &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspout.
<LI> A belief that government leaders know what's is best for us.
<LI> A belief in just doing what ever you want as long as it feels good.
<LI> A belief in freedom only for people who agree with you.
<LI> A belief in always doing things "MY" way no matter what.
<LI> A belief in using any and all drugs to excess.
<LI> A belief in socialism and communism.
<LI> A belief in the total wisdom (?) of human "Experts" as long as they agree with you.
<LI> A belief in Free Stuff. Nothing is free, Someone <B><U>ALWAYS</U></B> has to pay for it.

</lu>

<P> Can you name some countries that follow these mores? The former USSR? All Communist run countries? Socialist countries, can you say Venezuela? And now Democracies? And now the USA?

<P>Look at what is slowly starting. Gas prices are going up. Up a dollar from last year thanks to the "Fraudster". Up too is inflation, currently 5%, again thanks to the "Fraudster". European nations love the "Fraudster". Europeans can stop paying their share of NATO costs. More world taxes to pay that you don't get to vote on. No more successful peace treaties in the Middle East. Illegal aliens? Totally out of control and so is keeping our citizenship and health care intact. We had energy independence but not no more. The "Fraudster" will get us lots of Solar Panels, just like he did with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/remember-solyndra-loss-of-taxpayer-millions-seems-forgotten-expert-says" target="_blank"> Solyndra.</A> Critical Racist theory taught as fact in our schools. Black only TV channels. Black only subsidies from the government. Black only Student Union buildings. Really? And it is not considered racist? 

<P> Don't tell me President Trump did it. Don't tell me President Trump Lied. He did not. The National News Media did. Russia? A total hoax. Impeachments... all hoaxes. His supposedly racist and sexist statements? Everything the News Media points to, when I check them out, are lies. All lies made up by the News Media. Trump called dead Allied soldiers “losers.” A total lie. Energy independence? Only under Trump. Wuhan Virus? President Trump was right on everything, including that the Wuhan Virus was from a lab in Wuhan. Hydroxychloroquine? They now have many studies that show it works great on the Wuhan Virus. I could go on and on.

<P>Journalist Derek Hunter states, "Every anonymously sourced story, every “scandal,” deserves relentless scrutiny in general. But when so many, if not all of them related to the Trump Presidency, not only haven’t been confirmed by anyone on the record or by documentation, it makes you wonder if anything reported in the last 4 years was true. The Washington Post famously kept a running total of “Trump lies” on their website. As it turns out, their website, and the websites of their fellow “news” outlets were the biggest lies of them all." 

<P>With President Trump, America was First. With the "Fraudster" America is last. Trump even gave his Presidential salary back to America. I wonder what the "Fraudster" does with his?

<P>Our great nation is being torn apart by these "Woke" lunatics. They say we are the worst and most racist county in the world yet everyone and I mean <B>everyone</B> wants to come to America, the Shining City of the world.

<P> However, if we go back to man's mores, our wonderful country will go the way of Venezuela. From prosperity to no toilet paper, or anything else for that matter.

<P>Folks, we are fast approaching a Lexington and Concord moment. The <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/08/what_is_the_american_social_contract.html" target="_blank">American Social Contract</A> is collapsing. As the ridiculous call to defund the Police continues, The crime rate is skyrocketing. Well duh. Ecclesiastes 8:11 tells us, <B>“Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.”</B> Isn't that happening right now?


<P> America is NOT Europe or Asia. We paid the government, with our tax dollars, to supply law enforcement. If the government does not, we will do it ourselves. Americans will not give up our constitutional rights without a fight.

<center><h2><B>UPDATE! <BR> 2021<BR></B></H2></center>


<P><font size=4>Well, I give up. No one ever sends me any comments that disagree with my comments. No noth'en, nada, zip, zero, nothing. I am sorry to say but it must be true. The Progressive Democrats have based all they say on NOTHING. Oh well, you can still E-mail me.


<P>
<strike>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!</strike>
