<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!

<BR><BR>


<P>I was listening to all the Democratic and Republican BS going out and I remembered this Psalm and Matthew Henry's comment on it. Seems to  give me encouragement.

<P><B>Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:

<P> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
 
<P>The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</B>
<P>Psalms 12

<P>Matthew Henery's comment on this Psalm
<P>"The psalmist begs help of God, because there were none among
men whom he durst trust.

<P>This psalm furnishes good thoughts for bad times; a man may
comfort himself with such meditations and prayers. Let us see
what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so.
Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they
will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the
desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays
the badness of the times on causes of another nature, perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of
this David complains.

<P> When piety decays times really are bad. He
who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud,
profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and
needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself
takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of
the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those
in authority, then the times are very bad. 

<P>See with what good
things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot
tell what times we may be reserved for. 

<P>1. We have a God to go
to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our
grievances. 

<P>2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and
proud men. 

<P>3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed
people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are
false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God
is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined
to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its
power and truth! 

<P>God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad
the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a
generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put
into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety,
for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock,
they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come
with ever so much force upon them."

<P>It seems that the only thing government people are interested in is more power for themselves. It is true "The wicked walk on every side, when the <strike>vilest</strike> govenment men are exalted."

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
