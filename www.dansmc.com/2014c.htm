<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!
</Center>
<BR>
<center><H1>Thank for Voting in 2014</H1></center>


<P>Well, the 2014 election has come and gone. As some of you may know I am the Chief Election Judge for Precinct 61 of Kootenai County here in Idaho. We had 576 voters which made for a busy day. Nationally the voters threw a number of bums out of office and that is good. 

<P>President Obama and the progressives just do not seem to understand that they lost and the Republicans won. Hopefully that will mean in the 2015 American people will have won too.

<P>It is interesting how people will ignore the truth when it tramples on their cherished ideas. As some one once said "It's not that progressives are stupid, it is just that they believe so many things that are not true." If you look back in history you will find that this happens... a lot.

<P>Kings, Czars, Dictators, even ordinary people have this strange ability to ignore the obvious. Usually, it is with one of my customers who says "No, I haven't tested the compression but I am sure the engine has enough." or "No, I have not tested for a spark but I am sure the problem is this the carburetor." You would think that a smart knowledgeable person would know better but you would be wrong.

<P>A current case in point is this MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber. Why, why, why would an obviously smart person think that adding lots of new people to Health insurance plans, with no real way to pay for them, is a good idea? Doesn't the fact that you have to LIE to people to get this bill passed give you pause to wonder if it is a good thing? This guy thinks the American voter is stupid? It is not the voter that is the stupid one.

<P>They say the word "Moron" is applied to people with an IQ of 51-70, this being superior in one degree to "imbecile" (IQ of 26-50) which is superior in two degrees to "idiot" (IQ of 0-25). I wonder which one this MIT guy is? I'm thinking "Moron". Maybe we could use the word "Thief". It is coming out that our MIT guy was paid a lot of money. Maybe a million dollars or more for his so called work. Was what he did really work or was it embezzlement? Was it a crime? I think stealing a million dollars by lies and deceit is a crime. Didn't we put several big Wall Street brokers in jail a few years back for doing the exact same thing? Can you say Enron? Can you say Bernie Madoff? Yeah, they put him in jail, didn't they. I hope <U><B>everyone</B></U> who was part of this embezzlement is brought to justice.

<P>Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi says she never heard of Gruber but Oh Wow, they have video taken of her talking about him. I guess she just forgot. Yeah, that must be it. Right... sure.

<P>This so called "Affordable Care Act", better known as "Obama Care" is costing us a fortune and all for a lie. Maybe it is time for a little justice, don't you think? Maybe the attitude behind Obama Care, the lies, the arrogant superior attitudes, the I know what is best for you attitudes, needs to be dealt with and dealt with harshly. Do you think that is the real reason the Democrats lost so big in the last election? I do.

<P>The Republicans now have a chance to do what is right for the American people. The big question is, will they?

<h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS TO ME<BR></H1></center>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
