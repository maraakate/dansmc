<P><font size=4>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!

<center><h1>2016<BR>THE ELECTIONS</h1></center>
<BR>
 

<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4> Well, here we are. I have never seen our great country so divided. So now we must choose and hope our choice is good. How do we do that?

<P>When you get down to it we all want the same things. Enjoy life, have good health, enjoy our loved ones, have a good job, make some real money, ride our motorcycles and Enjoy Freedom. These are all things our present Federal Government does not want us to have. Why do I say that? Well, look at what we now have.

<P>1. Our health care is in shambles. We pay way too much for way to little. You want a little, tiny system wide example? Every time you go into your doctor for medical care you have to sign a permission to treat form. Why would you go to a doctor if you did not want to be treated for whatever ails you? Do you need this? No. It is just one little thing that sucks millions of dollars out of your healthcare. All to satisfy some unelected, mindless government bureaucrat's urge to control you. All for your own good, of course. 

<P>I have started signing this form with my name and adding the letters CF. This stands for Contra Fidem, which is Latin for against my will. Do you remember "You can keep your Doctor, you can keep your health Care Plane, Period"? Why do they do this? One more way to control you. I just heard that the third biggest health insurance company<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/aetna-obamacare_n_3839360.html" target="_blank"> Aetna is dropping Obamacare</A> because they were loosing too much money.

<P>2. Climate Change. I am 66 years old. I vividly remember the 1970s. They told us Global Cooling was going to make winters colder and colder. We were all going to die. Didn't happen. Next came the silent spring. Acid Rain was killing our countryside. We were all going to die. Didn't happen. Then came Global Warming. Hotter and Hotter. We were all going to die. Didn't happen. Now they are wising up and calling it Climate Change. Wow, that takes in everything and I bet the climate really will change tomorrow. It is called Weather. However, the plea is always the same. Give me lots of money and I will save you. Oh yes, It is all settled science. Ignore that man behind the curtain. These are not the Droids you are looking for.

<P> You still don't believe me? Still believe they are not doing this for the money? I have three words for you "Ozone Al" Gore.

<P>4. Shovel ready projects. One Trillion bucks spent and wasted. Can you name me even one project that was successful?

<P>5. Green power. Do you remember Solindra? Where did all those Billions, given to Solindra, go? How about <a href="gasohol.htm" target="_blank">Gasohol</a>? A dead horse who's stink is ruining our engines.

<P>6. A thirty hour work week. Because of Obamacare our unskilled young can't get a good paycheck because they can't work a full week for the same Boss. Don't believe me? See how many hours the kids you know get to work.

<P>7. Good paying jobs are way, way down. Minimum wage junk jobs are up. The establishment plays with the numbers to make it look like it is all OK but millions have given up even looking for work. Are you doing OK?

<P>8. Want to know how a single payer, government run health care would work? Look at the VA health care system. You really want that?



<P>I can go on and on. The establishment in both parties is totally corrupt. The fix is in. As one man said "We need to fix the system" and another said "How much more fixed can it get?". Still don't believe me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8e5a19bRAs" target="_blank">Back in 2013 Governor Jeb Bush gave an award to Hillary Clinton.</A> An award for public service. Really? The only public she has been servicing are the donors to the Clinton Foundation, like Saudi-Arabia, Wall Street and others. The foundation only gives about <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/27/in-2013-the-clinton-foundation-only-spent-10-percent-of-its-budget-on-charitable-grants/" target="_blank">10-15% of the money it takes in to charity.</A>

<P>Remember the big deal the Clintons and their Foundation made about helping Haiti? <font size=5><B>NOT</B></font>. Haitians were demonstrating outside the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s" target="_blank">Democratic Convention.</A> An Haitian-American named Joseph Mathieu accused the Clintons of "destroying Haiti for the decades. They pretend to be our friends when in reality they are our number one enemies... the Clintons were running Haiti, stealing our money, our resources and we are out here, outraged for the crimes of the Clintons!"  Read more about it <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2016/09/03/hillary-cares-about-you-ask-the-haitians-she-ripped-off-n2213504?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=" target="_blank"> HERE.</A>

<P> Like I said The fix is in.

<P>So what are we to do? The establishment Democrats and Hillary just lie to us constantly. The establishment Republicans are doing the same thing. You hear me Jeb Bush? You hear me Ted Cruz? They, the establishment on both sides, are constantly lying to us.

<P>The only person in the political world who has not blatantly lied to me is Donald Trump.

<P>Yes, Mr. Trump has some warts but so do I and so do you. His positives far out weigh his negatives. He has two things that we, as a nation, desperately need. He is not of the political establishment and he is a deal maker. That is what we need. A deal maker. We desperately need to come together and make a deal. 

<P>What kind of deal? A deal/deal. So what is a deal/deal? It is a deal where <B>BOTH</B> sides win by giving up something. What a novel idea. Everyone gives a little, everyone wins a lot. Our government is incapable of working with its self. We all need someone to start making deals.

<P>Think about it. Bernie Bros, all that free stuff, it can't all happen but some of it can if we come together and make a deal. Hilary is lying to you like she always does. She is establishment bought and paid for. The ultimate street walker. The only reason she is not in jail is because the "Fix" is in. Do you really want to be one with that crooked force? 

<P>Never Trumpers are lying <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/RINO" target="_blank">Rinos</a>. Part of the same establishment. We gave them the House and then the Senate but nothing happens. Want to guess why? Again, do you really want to be part of that?

<P>Donald Trump is most definitely <font size=5><B>NOT</B></font> from the establishment. He can make a deal with both sides to benefit both sides. That is what he does. He even wrote a book on it. Want proof? The Republican establishment hates him. The Democrat establishment hates him. Other establishment Billionaires hate him. That means I like him. Trump is the head of the anti-establishment movement. I want to be a part of that.

<P>If you don't like what Trump says, start finding out what he really said. I hear these wild things from the in-the-bag for Hillary national news. Then I hear what he <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/whats-trumps-position-on-nato/" target="_blank">actually said</A> and WOW, there is quite a difference. Example. They said he was against helping NATO countries if they were attacked. That was NOT what he said. He said NATO countries need to start paying what they agreed to pay when they joined NATO. Why do we have to pay for everything? 

<P>Another example would be Trump mocking the disabled reporter. He did not. Check it out <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2016/08/31/media-invented-lie-about-trump-mocking-disabled-reporter-n2212715?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad" target="_blank" target="_blank">HERE.</a> 

<P>How about "The Benghazi Babe's" claim that Trump is a racist because Trump's Apartment managers, from the Trump organization, wrote "C" on tenant applications to identify those people as "colored" back in 1972 and early 1973? Trump did not didn't take over control of the Trump organization, from his father, until late in 1973 at 27 years old. By 1975, likely realizing that rogue, property managers in a couple of their apartment buildings had clearly violated the law, he settled the case.  

<P>As Bryan Crabtree points out "How does this make Donald Trump racist when a company he was not running, in facilities he did not oversee, by managers who did not directly report to him, discriminated against people because of their race? Isn't it possible that he simply had a few racist employees?" Read more <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/bryancrabtree/2016/09/03/racist-trump--racism-in-america-n2213502?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=" target="_blank">HERE.</A>

<P>There are many other examples. 


<P>Point is we need to do what the Bible tells us. <B>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</B> Wake up folks. This may be our last chance to pull our collective heads out of our <a href="fourth_point.htm" target="_blank">fourth point of contact</A> and realize what is happening to our nation. The Benghazi Babe will ruin us. If it's not poor leadership like at Benghazi, it will be losing national secrets over her E-Mail or selling us out to big money, Clinton Foundation donors. Dare anyone call it what it is? A Bribe for favors. 

<P>The economy sucks, reread my first eight points. Everyone overseas laughs at us and we are letting a foreign army into our country and they are stealing our children's inheritance. They are called <Font size=5 color=red>Illegal</font> Immigrants. Think walls won't work? They worked at both the Republican AND Democratic conventions.

<P>Hilary let four Americans die at Benghazi and lied about it. Trump gave Twenty-five thousand dollars to help <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2014/11/10/donald-trump-writes-25k-check-sgt-andrew-tahmooressi"  target="_blank">Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi</A> after Obama ignored him and left him to rot in Mexico. In the end that is what our choice really is. Ignored Death or Hopeful Start.

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
