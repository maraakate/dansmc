<BR>
 

<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4> Finally, the dark years of Obama are over. I sincerely hope President Trump uses his pen and phone to reverse everything that Obama has done to us.

<P>Thankfully, a long year of nothing but election coverage is over. Now, we the American People, need to do something. We need to come together.

<P>Remember when Barack Obama was first elected to be president? I and other conservatives were Very displeased but we still gave President Obama a chance to lead. As it turned out he was the most divisive President that I can remember. I can't think of ANYTHING he has done right and no he did not kill Osama bin Laden. The army he inherited from Bush did that.


<P> We marched in the streets but we DID NOT destroy any property or burn anything down. At the end of the protests we put our trash in public trash cans or piled it neatly beside them. No one was ever hurt. 

<P>The Democrats ignored us. The disaster named The Affordable Care Act was rammed down our collective throats without even one Republican vote. You can keep your Doctor, you can keep your Health Care Plan, you will save money. All lies. But one thing was true. Elections have consequences as Progressive Democrat liberals and Establishment Republicans are now finding out.

<P>Good news for me, bad news for Progressives... or maybe not!  President Donald Trump is a deal maker. Think of it this way. A good deal means BOTH sides get something. BOTH sides WIN. In any real deal both sides start with wanting something totally outrageous. Then each side gives up just a little bit and the opposing sides move just a  bit closer together. We keep doing that till we come to an agreement, a deal.

<P>So, let us come together and make a deal. Let us come together and be at peace with one another. I know the really hard core Progressives are so filled with hate that they will never stop hating but I'm not talking to them... I am talking to you. You are a Democrat or Republican who has started to see that the establishment of both parties has lied to us. As Gods word tells us in the book of James, Chapter 4:

<P><font size=5><B>"From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.

<P>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God.  

<P>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

<P> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

<P> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

<P> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

<P>I know you have been taught that we are racist, sexist and deplorable. They lied to you. <a href="info.htm">Start checking up on the facts.</A>

<P>As Democrat Doug Schoen Said on December 24th, 2016 on Fox News<B> "We have got to, on Christmas Day recognize that we are one nation, we are not Democrats and Republicans,  we are one nation under God and we're all committed to freedom and liberty."</B>

<P>We are not the dark side we are the Right Side.

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
