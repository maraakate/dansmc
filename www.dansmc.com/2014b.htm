<P>What is wrong with you people? 

<P>Here we go again. I guess I should not be surprised. I can see it back in the day. You're an Aztec, walking home in Tenochtitlan, looking to pick up some Tacos, go home and crash and WOW, here they go again. If we don't do something the Wolf is going to eat the Sun. The world will then end. Just like last year, the year before and the year before that. They need more money and a lot more human sacrifices. Better take a side street or they might want to draft me into being a sacrifice. But we have to do it with someone. Just not me. If we don't, there goes the Sun. I mean really. You want to be safe don't you?

<P>Fast forward to today. If we don't do something right now we are all going to die. Just send money and the government will make sure we are all safe. You do want to be safe, don't you? It is the same be they Republicans or be they Democrats. Just make sure you give us lots of money and we will stop the Wolf from eating the Sun. You want to be safe don't you? But there is good news and bad news.

<P>The good news is that the bad is not quite as bad as they say. The bad news is that the good is not nearly good enough.

<P>Some of you young people out there may not remember good old Vietnam. I joined the US Army in 1971 and went to the 82nd Airborne. So I never went to Vietnam. I went to Ft Bragg, North Carolina and there I rotted for three years. However, lots of my fellow soldiers did go to Vietnam. Just before Vietnam started they had a big vote in Vietnam. Basically, arguably, the people where asked if they wanted to go with a king or not. However, everything was kind of goofy and the fix was in. Wouldn't you know it, we backed the wrong side. We backed the thieves and robbers and expected people with no grade school education to vote wisely. What could possibly go wrong? 

<P>But one thing was for sure. Beyond any doubt. If we did not go over there and stick our collective noses in other people's business, the Wolf was going to eat the Sun. All the eastern countries would fall like dominos and Communism would take over the world. Can you pronounce California in Vietnamese? Well, while we won all the battles, killed a lot of people, spent lots and lots of money, we still lost. 

<P>Guess what happened. The Wolf did not eat the Sun. In fact, come to think about it, the Wolf never eats the Sun. Wow, who could have seen that coming? Well, ah, you could have. It is your fault because you did not do your homework and elected the biggest group of Horse's Petutes the world has ever seen. We, the voters, are the rulers. Maybe that makes US the biggest Horse's Petutes too.

<P>Now we have both parties telling us the Wolf (ISIS) is going to eat the Sun (The World) if we don't give them lots of money and Human sacrifices to stop them. Does this sound familiar?

<P>What is wrong with you people?

<P>People, you have to start thinking and voting. Think about it. We have spent at least a Trillion and a half dollars and thousands of American lives to give freedom to Iraq and they have lost it all. Same with Afghanistan. The only thing all the Arabs agree on is that they all hate us, but they do all love our guns and money. Now the powers that be, both parties, want to jump back in to keep the Wolf from eating the Sun. All those desperate Christians on top of that mountain? Bang, they are all saved. A few air strikes and ISIS, who would take over the world, are driven off. Sounds a bit too easy does it not? Now I'm not saying we shouldn't intervene when the need arises. But I am saying we need to do it a bit smarter then we usually do.

<P>I have a customer who is a Police Officer. He patrols the back country here in North Idaho. He was telling me about these idiots who go into the back country with no survival gear. No maps, no food, no water, no nothing. Just jump in the old beater, be it a snowmobile, car, truck, motorcycle, whatever, and go. They break down and maybe they call out with a cell phone or family member calls and says they just noticed, on Wednesday, that he never came back last weekend. No they don't know where he is except he is in the woods. So my Police Officer friend goes out to find him. When he does find him, and he always does, he brings him back after rendering the necessary First Aid. Thing is, he only brings the live person back. Whatever machine the poor dummy used to get himself into trouble with is left out there. He only saves people, not machines.

<P>That is what we need to do. Save the persons then kick them free and go on our way. The war is not so costly, it is the ten years of nation building that is costly. As it is now we free them, rebuild their houses,  put their kids through college and give their leaders lots of money. All the while ignoring the big economic problems we have here in the USA. To top it off no one is appreciative for the things we have done for them. How about from now on we just stop them killing each other and leave it at that?

<P>Back around 2003 I read a statement by a young Sergeant in Iraq. He asked "If you saw some one beating up a woman on the street wouldn't you help her?" He likened that woman to the people of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. I agree with him up to a point and that point is this. Ask any Policeman who is the most dangerous person to him in a domestic dispute. It is not the unruly man who beat up the girl. It is the woman who sticks a knife in you when you try to restrain her man. That is who you have to watch out for. 

<P>We may want to help these people but the ones in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere do not want our help. They want us to go away. We should give them what they want. A lot of these people are bred to war yet after ten years and more of training their soldiers, they still can't seem to fight.  

<P>To fully train a motivated individual takes about seven to nine months. Take that fat, beer guzzling, college student, give him two months of Basic training, two months of Advanced training, a month for Airborne training, and finally a couple of months of Ranger training and you have a fully trained trooper who can plan, organize, and execute any kind of squad sized military mission that needs to be done. With holidays and days off he is fully trained in eight, nine months tops.

<P>So it has been over ten years training for the Iraqi and Afghan armies and they still can't do the job. But they were able to kill one of our Generals for no reason. <B>THE REAL REASON THEY AREN'T DOING THE JOB IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO.</B>

<P>Senator McCain wants to go back in and start all over. President Obama is like a deer caught in the headlights, and you still voted these people back in office.

<P>What is wrong with you people?

<P>It is your fault these idiots are in office pushing through their ruinous polices. President Obama's loser policies where well known in 2012. Senator McCain? Yeah, I voted for him as the lesser of two evils in 2008. That will not happen again. I'm a slow learner but I do learn but you can blame me too. 

<P>What is wrong with us?

<P>Now we are told ISIS will is a big, BIG threat. The Wolf is going to eat the Sun. GIVE US MORE MONEY AND WE WILL SAVE YOU! Give me a break. In WW2 Germany had well over six million men in their army. They were a threat. The Japanese had almost as many. They were a threat. ISIS? Five to ten thousand. That's a threat? Any big city Ghetto gang worth it's salt can do better then that. The ISIS economic base? Stolen US equipment and stolen US money. Once it is gone, and war has a tendency to use up equipment, it is gone. 

<P>What, exactly, will ISIS do then? Oh yeah, oil. Do you know how easy it is to bomb an oil field? Or perhaps they can corner the world market on sand boxes?

<P>But wait. Isn't ISIS a danger? That is the bad part of the news. They are a big danger if they get over here and that is the problem. Our borders are wide open. All they have to do is walk in and do it. Do you really think if we waste our money bombing them over there that it will prevent them from slipping over the borders and bombing us here? We have lucked out because all these Islamic Terrorists are so incredibly backward and stupid. How long do you think they will stay that way? Yet we ignore the Borders, we ignore our own laws. Do you think the terrorists will ignore our laws too? Nah, that's just crazy talk, right?

<P>The powers that be are already talking about "Shared Responsibilities" and the next word they use is "Draft". Just to be fair, right? The Wolf is going to eat the Sun! Just like the Aztecs long ago. They are going to need a lot of money and warm bodies for the Human Sacrifices. Think you and yours will be able to get down that side street in time?

<P>Pull your head out of your <a href="fourth_point.htm" target="_blank">forth point of contact</A>, take a deep breath, clear your head, study the issues and candidates and <B>VOTE.</B>

<center><font size=5><B>All is not lost.  Remember Psalms 127:1 <BR><BR>"Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."

<BR><BR>


Even when times are tough we can do as Psalms 100 says:
<BR><BR>
<B>"Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Serve the LORD with gladness:<BR> come before his presence with singing.<BR> Know ye that the LORD he is God: <BR>it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;<BR> we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.<BR> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:<BR> be thankful unto him, and bless his name.<BR> For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting;<BR> and his truth endureth to all generations."</B>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
