<P><font size=4>Well, we were hit on November 5th, 2009. I'm about 90% sure that this was indeed a terrorist attack but I'm still going to give the Demos a walk on this one. It was one man, not a group. Was he just a lone loon? Maybe... we'll see. For now we will wait and see what the future brings.

<P>December 25. We get hit again. If the fuse for the Terrorist bomb on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 had worked everyone on the plane would have been killed. Obama's new policy of treating these Terrorists as simple criminals is an abysmal failure. So the Democrats lasted about 336 days. Not a very good showing!

<center><h2>January 2009</h2></center>
<BR>

<P>Well, now we have a new President and Congress with the Democrat party in control in the USA. Now the fun begins! Our new President Obama promised us change and he sure delivered. He has changed more then any President that I can remember and I first got interested in politics back when Goldwater and Johnson were fighting it out for President. We now have the Clintons back. For over a year, in the primaries, the President Obama said we needed change and that the ideas of the Clintons were all wrong. Seems to me he is the only one who changed! 

<P>However, this is probably a good thing. Let us hope it works. 

<P>It's not surprising that we are in an economic crises. By printing all this extra money we have ensured that any return on savings accounts is down in the 1/4% range. I read that we have increased our money supply by 70% since October, 2008.

<P>So now we bail out all these companies which have been so poorly managed by giving, what amounts to, free money to the same managers who ran their companies into the ground. Does that sound good to you? 

<P>The US Senate and House have now passed a stimulus bill. President Obama says all the economists say this is what we need. I guess he forgot about <a href="http://www.cato.org/special/stimulus09/alternate_version.html" target="_blank">these economists.</A>

<P>Tell me, can you name a time or place when spending more borrowed money has ever helped anyone, including a nation, get out of debt? They say when your in a hole the first thing you need to do is stop digging.

<P>One could be depressed about all of this, but I'm not! I just apply one of the lessons I learned in the 82nd Airborne. What lesson? Just this... Have a Party!

<P>When I was a paratrooper in the 82nd we used any excuse to have a party. If things are good, bad or neutral, have a party. Let me explain how this works. If you make a parachute jump only one of three things can happen.

<OL>
<LI>You make a successful jump and land uninjured. That is good so we have a party!
<LI>You make a jump and things go wrong and you break a leg. Well, now you get to go home for several months of medical leave. That is good. So we have a party!
<LI>You make a jump, the chute fails, you streamer in and die. Well, my friend, you are now out of the army, and that is very good indeed. So we have a party!
</OL>

<P>So let us apply this to our current political situation.

<OL>
<LI>The Democrats are right and the stimulus works and we all are SAVED and make lots of money! What's not to like? Let's have a party!
<LI>Things are not so good. The stimulus does not work and we are all out of work. Well, we toss the Democrats out of office and we have a party! Again, what's not to like?
<LI>The Democrats let all the terrorists go and they turn around and Nuke Washington DC. We get all new leaders, who just might have a clue. Hey, what's not to like? 
<BR><BR>

<center><font size=6>LET'S HAVE A PARTY!</font></center>
</OL>

This principal can be applied to many things in life. Again, what's not to like!<BR>

<P>The people in Congress are just going BONKERS with spending. As usual the Demos are saying it's Bush's fault! What is interesting is that they are half right. What they don't want to remember or admit is that the Democrats have controlled Congress for two years. A full one half of the blame is theirs. 

<P>I found an interesting web site that offers up a number of YouTube videos. I do love the name

<P>The economic mess just keeps getting deeper. They say that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. AIG is getting their fourth bail out and GM is asking for a second. The Republicans started it and the Democrats going crazy with it but the fact remains... goverment bail outs do not work!

<P>Government is not the answer. Government is the problem. This presents a very irritating problem. The Republican party has abandoned their ideals of less government and more fiscal responsibility. The Democrats are just spend, spend, spend. Now the Demos claim the Republicans are all wrong but they do the same thing, bailouts, only more so. 

<P>The reason for ALL the real estate problems is simple. People bought houses that they could not afford. At one time people were required to come up with a good down payment and to have a good enough job to afford a house payment. Then BOTH the Republicans AND the Democrats decided that everyone should be able to buy a house whether they could afford it or not. The politicians put strong pressure on the lending institutions of the country to lend to anybody and everybody. These people borrowed money they could not pay back. Bad decisions all the way around. Now the bill is due and there is no money to pay it. The cure is to let these people and lending institutions go bankrupt. We simply do not have the money to bail everyone out. Such is life.

<P>Now with all this economic mess going down it occurs to me some people may not understand how our loan system works. Back around 1981 I took some economic and accounting courses at a local college. If you want to see how really big of mess we are truly in simply study economics. If you want to know how they hide it all, study accounting!

<P>It's like this. You take $100.00 and put it in a savings account. The bank then takes 6 % of those dollars and keeps it on hand to cover any withdrawals you might make. The rest is loaned to  someone. That someone takes the $94.00 they borrowed and puts it in another bank who keeps 6 % and loans the rest. This keeps going until all the money is gone. If you do the math this produces something like $600.00 in loans (At least it did in 1981). All that from $100.00 in savings. 

<P>That is the theory and it does work... on paper, well, sort of. If you keep enough money for day to day operations (That 6 %), make sure you get good collateral for the loans (20 % down, the house its self), and everybody truly believes. Truly believes? Well, folks, take 100 dollar bills and try to make 600 out of it. Yeah, your right. You really only have 100 dollars. The rest? You just have to believe.

<P>Now remember, that was back in 1981. Today? Maybe they keep 1-2 % and they loan to absolutely anyone who can sign their name. No down 'cause hey, the value of that house will just go up and up, right? Well, it did, but not any more. Both the Republicans and the Democrats are up to their eyeballs in this. It seems almost all the politicians of both parties will do just about ANYTHING to get/stay elected and NOT take responsibility for this mess we are in. This is why Bush pushed through that 500 billion dollars "stimulus" plan. Obama and company are doing the exact same thing. 

<P>Wow, now the Senators are talking about passing a clearly unconstitutional law to take away the bonus checks given to the AIG people. Which, I am told, are not really a bonus but part of their pay, given in a different way. Now the Senate agreed to these contract bonuses last week but now these executives are evil so the senators blame them and of course Bush did it! 

<P>A person could get depressed about all of this. Perhaps it's time to put our trust in some real gold!<BR><BR>
<center><font size=5><B>Revelation 3:18<BR> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich;<BR> and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy<BR> nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve,<BR> that thou mayest see.</B></font>

<P>A nice gentleman from Sweden e-mailed and asked if I was having doubts about our system here. I had to tell him no. I still believe we have the best, most successful, economic system the world has ever known. Now if President Obama's government would just stop pushing socialism on us, we will continue to be great. 

<P>I ran across a great quote from the Movie "The Wind and the Lion". Supposedly President Theodore Roosevelt said this in 1903. He didn't but it still is a good quote anyway.

<P>"The American grizzly is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. Maybe a little blind and reckless at times... but courageous beyond all doubt. And one other trait that goes with all previous. 
 
<P> Loneliness. The American grizzly lives out his life alone. Indomitable, unconquered - but always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies, but none of them as great as he. 
 
<P>The world will never love us. They respect us - they might even grow to fear us. But they will never love us, for we have too much audacity! And, we're a bit blind and reckless at times too."

<P>As Winston Churchill once said "And that's the truth, or at least it should be!"

<P>My Daughter and I went to the April 15th Coeur d' Alene Tea Party. It was originally supposed to be at the office of our local US Congressman. He's a Democrat! Well, they changed it to the Coeur d' Alene park. I figured that maybe 50-60 people would show up. Boy, was I wrong! The local news people said about 1000 or more showed up. I think there were a lot more then that!

<P>This was a real grass roots sort of thing and certainly not put on by the Republicans. I didn't hear much talk about President Oboma. I only heard talk about his and the Republicans BAD economic policies. People are very dissatisfied with our government's over spending. The 2010 elections are just around the corner. I think there are going to be a lot of surprised politicians on that day. Here are some pictures I took at the rally. There were something like 700 to 750 Tea Party rallies around the country yet they were all ignored by the national media.

<P>Getting true information seems to be getting harder ad harder. I don't even watch the three major TV news networks anymore. I've caught them in too many lies to trust them. The local newspaper is getting smaller and smaller. Print seems to be dying. I want the truth, not a bunch of BS. I like Fox news because they really do seem to be fair and balanced. At least I have not caught them in any lies.  But I want MORE! This is how I get it.

White House Affirms Deal on Drug Cost
By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK<BR>

<P>"WASHINGTON � Pressed by industry lobbyists, White House officials on Wednesday assured drug makers that the administration stood by a behind-the-scenes deal to block any Congressional effort to extract cost savings from them beyond an agreed-upon $80 billion.

Drug industry lobbyists reacted with alarm this week to a House health care overhaul measure that would allow the government to negotiate drug prices and demand additional rebates from drug manufacturers."

<P>I thought President Obama said no more Lobbyists in his White House. It's just a little thing. Perhaps one of the least of things.  Now he wants us to believe and trust him with our health care. Jesus says in Luke 16:10:

<P>I just read an article by a gentleman who felt that the reason the little netbook laptop computers were so popular is that we are now accepting technology that is "Just good enough". That we were not wanting all the best laptops and desktops because we were accepting garbage as being good enough.
<P>I thought to myself, "What a load of BS"! I just bought a little Acer netbook running XP. I paid $300.00 for it and it does everything I need a computer to do. I'm getting five hours of battery life, runs all the software I use, plays movies. I have a Bluetooth wireless mouse for it. I can carry it anywhere and connect to the internet wirelessly. It has a brilliant display and I love it. This guy thinks I'm accepting "Just good enough" when I should demand a $2500 Mac laptop.

This got me to thinking. I remember when we landed on the moon. That was in 1969. I watched it as it happened on TV. Since then, only 12 people have waked on the moon. If you look at a lot of the science fiction movies since then guess what?
<center><font size=6><B>We were supposed to be on Mars by now!!!</B></font></center>
<P>I remember it was a done deal in 1970. We were going to Mars and beyond. What hopes we had. Think of the things we could have discovered along the way. 

<P>That super hot Mac is only worth about $200 more than my $300 net book. It's not that I'm accepting "Good enough", it's that what he's offering is NOT WORTH IT! I should have a computer that folds up like a handkerchief when off and hardens up to a laptop when on. It should connect to satellites and have a  thousand hour battery life.

She wanted to know "What would Jesus do about climate change". Mike had a good answer. He said Jesus would seek the truth. That was a good answer except for the fact that it was a very worldly answer.

<P>The truth is that Jesus doesn't give a rip about Polar bears, snail darter fish or spotted owls, But he does give a rip about you. A rich young ruler came to Jesus once and basically asked him the same question. The young man wanted a great feat he could do. Jesus told him to sell all his possessions and come and follow him. This, the young ruler would not do. Jesus didn't care about giving money to the poor. He cared about that young man. Jesus knew the thing the young ruler needed most was to follow him. 

<P>Things have not changed in two thousand years. Jesus does not worry about Mother Earth. With a blink of his eyes he can make a hundred Earths. Earth is not the issue... you are.

<P>Wise men still seek him.

<P>Believe in and follow Jesus and all other things will be added unto you.
