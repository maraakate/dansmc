<P><font size=4>2014... As I look at our inept Governments handling of the Ebola problem I just have to shake my head in disbelief. Like a small fire this should be easy to control, as long as you don't let it get out of hand. If it does get out of hand... WOW, look out!

<P>I don't think we have much to worry about but doesn't it bother you that these Doctors and Nurses, with full protective gear, still seem to get Ebola? President Obama has really taken control and put an experienced political activist in command to oversee all that money he hopes will get put into the Ebola fight.

<P>I don't know if a quarantine of people from Ebola areas is the best action to take but we quarantine pet dogs who travel. That seems to work, why not use it here.

<P>However, that is not why I am writing this page. A few months ago I read a short Journal about what happened to the French city of Marseilles in 1720. This is what happens when things DO get out of control. Think it can't happen here? We can handle a few hundred sick people. Do you think we can handle 200,000? I really don't think it can happen but then we all thought the ObamaCare web site would work like Amazon.com didn't we?

Here it comes again. Can you say Wuhan virus? Quack Fauci says no mask, then two masks, then three, then who knows? Then quackeroo-in-chief Biden says non Vaccinated people pose a threat to Vaccinated people. Huh? Is he saying the Vaccine does not work? What? Just like Afghanistan only with a virus!
