<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4> I am amazed at how much the no haters hate and how much the tolerant people are intolerant. My daughter has a number of novel writer friends who post all kinds of things on Face Book. One of them cut and copied the following points from somebody named R****** K******. I didn't give his name because I haven't really seen his post, even after a search.

<P> However, I think his points cover most of the Progressive Talking Points which are, basically, I hate Trump and anyone who voted for him because I hate hate. Got that? They don't know me but they hate me because I am so hateful. They can't tell my why I'm so hateful but I am, just take their word for it.

<P>How can we deal with so many people who hate us for no reason? I saw a sign the other day which said this. " Progressives are not stupid, it is just that they <U>KNOW</U> so many things that are not true." I can understand that Progressives don't like what has happened but they must start realizing that the Progressive things they have done for the last eight years just have not worked very good. If you add Establishment Republicans to the mix we have about sixteen years of doing things that just have not worked very good. That is why We, the Great Unwashed, the Deplorables, Elected President Trump.

<P>I came up with at least ten things we can agree with each other on in the following list. That is almost one third of the list. Ten things you could, with logical arguments, get your way on. But if you will not work with me because you hate me for no reason, very soon now I will ignore you and you will become irrelevant. It's up to you. 

<P><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Read my replies after each section sign.

<P> The Jews have an interesting evening prayer prayed before you go to bed. It goes like this.

<P>"Master of the universe, I hereby forgive anyone who angered or antagonized me or sinned against me  whether physically or financially or through disrespect, or in any other matter affecting me; whether involuntarily or willfully, carelessly or deliberately; whether by word or by deed. I forgive every person: let no one incur punishment because of me."

<P>Maybe we, both Conservative and Liberal Progressive, should try that. What could it hurt?

<BR><BR><center><img src="wrench2.gif"></center><BR><BR>

<P>From R****** K******: 

<P>"Some people are saying that we should give Donald Trump a chance, that we should "work together" with him because he won the election and he is "everyone's president." This is my response:

<OL>

<LI> I will not forget how badly he and so many others treated former President Barack Obama for 8 years...
<br>
<ul><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I guess we remember things differently. I remember all the alphabet press having a tingle down their collective legs (perhaps a Depends failure, we will never know). I don't remember President Trump saying much of anything about Obama UNTIL he was campaigning for president.</font></ul><p>

<LI> I will not "work together" to build a wall.<BR>

<ul><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> "Good fences make good neighbors." An old saying but true in many cultures. German, Norwegian, Russian, Japanese and Hindi cultures all have versions of this quote. If walls do not work why is Former President Obama building a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4095126/Workers-seen-building-wall-Obamas-new-Washington-DC-home.html" target="_blank">wall</A> around his house in Washington DC? Works for the <a href="http://markhumphrys.com/israel.wall.html" target="_blank">Israelis</A> too. Other <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/world/2009/walls_around_the_world/default.stm" target="_blank">walls</A>.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to persecute Muslims.<BR>

<ul><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> The travel ban DID NOT ban Muslims. It banned people from unstable nations who are not vetted as to if they are a terrorist or not. Now you do realize that every terrorist attack in the past few years was done by Lutheran Grandmothers. NOT. All those attacks were by Islamic Terrorists, who are all Muslims. Think about it. They want to kill YOU.</ul><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to shut out refugees from countries where we destabilized their governments, no matter how bad they might have been, so that we could have something more agreeable to our oligarchy.<BR></UL>

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Wow, we might agree here. I thought we were freeing Iraq from a horrible monster. Have you read anything about <a href="http://history1900s.about.com/od/saddamhussein/a/husseincrimes.htm" target="_blank">Saddam Hussein</A>? We almost did it but Obama squandered it all. One Trillion dollars and thousands of lives down the tubes. What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" target="_blank">Muammar Gaddafi</A> and Libya. A littler monster but Hilary and Obama fixed him and the Libyans are still paying the price. </UL>

<P><UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> But, <a href="http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-oligarchy.htm" target="_blank">oligarchy</A>? Yeah, I'll go for that. Can you say Clintons? Can you say Bush? Can you say Senator ??? or Representative ???. All were broke when they went into office and after twenty or thirty years in office are now sitting real good. They are all establishment, dare I say an oligarchy? They all hate President Trump. That is why I like him. We both love and welcome <U>real</U> refugees and <U>Legal</U> Immigrants.</ul><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to lower taxes on the 1%.

<ul><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Really? Have you read my <a href="eco-beer.htm" target="_blank">"The USA Tax System
Explained in Beer"</A>? Read it. It's short. Now, tell me what percentage of their income should they give to the poor? To be fair shouldn't that be what you pay too? There are, after all, a lot of people in the world that make a <a href="http://www.africapay.org/ghana/home/salary/minimum-wages" target="_blank">LOT less</A> then you do. Shouldn't we take that percentage and apply it to you? Just to be fair you know. </ul><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to increase taxes on the middle class and poor.<BR>

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. Can you say Obamacare? This effects one fifth of our economy. A very sneaky tax that we were told was not a tax. It ended up cutting the work hours of the working poor to under 30 hours a week. Just ask any minimum wage earners how many hours they get to work in a week. But they all now have Health Insurance. Now, if they can only pay that $5000-$8000 deductible they could have Health Care too.</ul><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to help Trump use the Presidency to line his pockets and those of his cronies.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Again, Really? What sense does that make. He takes <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/donald-trump-salary-cbs-60-minutes/2016/11/13/id/758656/" target="_blank">one dollar for a salary</A>. He is already loaded. He does not need or want your money. Because of that he has no donors. He does not owe donors anything. His only loyalty is to the voters. That is why the Establishment hates him.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to weaken and demolish environmental protection.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> All of us want clean water and air. However the EPA has gone crazy. Stupid and arrogant <a href="http://wastefraudandabuse.org/stupid-epa-regulations/" target="_blank">regulations</A> hurt us all.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to sell American lands to companies which then despoil those lands.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Like with a lot of progressives you are being unclear. I'm not sure which American Lands you mean. If you want to educate your opponents you need to be more specific. What lands, where, when, how?</UL><p>

<LI> I will not "work together" to enable the killing in any way of whole species of animals just because they are predators, or inconvenient for a few, or because some people want to get their thrills killing them.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Hmm. Killing whole species? inconvenient for a few? See point # 22. What is the difference between killing a deer and killing a steer? You eat both. Oh, that's right your a vegetarian. Do you really think a plant does not want to live? Put up an electric fence. Plants will grow away from it. Some flowers open in the morning and close up at night. Plants do have a limited awareness. For you to live, something else has to die. That is life. Get used to it.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to remove civil rights from anyone.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. The only problem is that you want to give my Civil Rights to people who come here ILLEGALLY. That is unfair to me and unfair to real immigrants who obey the law. We are going to build a wall and keep illegal aliens out of our country. We are going to kick criminal aliens out of our country. It is going to happen. Live with it. If you want a say in what happens to the rest of the Illegal Aliens, change your attitude and work with us.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to waste trillions more on our military when we already have the strongest in the world.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. We need to be more efficient in our military expenditures. We need to stop nation building. We need to get out of all these foreign wars. However, we need a strong military and that costs money. If You Want Peace, Prepare for <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/warfareconflictarmor/f/PrepareforWar.htm" target="_blank">War</A>. Bullies pick on the weak, not the strong. Well, maybe they do pick on the strong... but only once.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to alienate countries that have been our allies for as long as I have been alive.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Progressives are always a bit vague about their facts. I assume you are talking about Mexico. Lovely Mexico who sends us her criminals and drugs. Or are you  talking about Obama giving that Churchill bust back to England? </UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to slash funding for education.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> The government brags about a <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_coi.asp" target="_blank">High School graduation rate of 82 %</A> which is pretty bad. Would you go to a mechanic who could only fix your car 82 % of the time? The Schools have way more money then they need. Compare <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-worldwide-ranking-of-math-science-reading-skills-2016-12" target="_blank">The US rankings</A> in Math, Reading and Science. Estonia beats us in all three. Compare how much <a href="https://rossieronline.usc.edu/u-s-education-versus-the-world-infographic/" target="_blank">money is spent</a> on each student. We need School Choice and we are going to get it.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to take basic assistance from people who are at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree sort of. The Bible tells us in Second Thessalonians 3:10  "... if any would not work, neither should he eat." We need to require some kind of work for the free hand out. We shouldn't be handing out credit cards. We should just give basic staples of cheap food. Milk, Beans, Cheese, Bread, maybe some Ramen Noodles too. Nothing like a few weeks of Beans and Ramen Noodles to get you pounding the streets for a job. Benjamin Franklin said "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion about the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it."

</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to allow torture and "black op" prison sites.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> You mean, of course, Water Boarding. Unpleasant but hardly torture. When I went through Basic Training in the Army they taught us about CS Tear Gas. They took us into a big tent, popped off several CS Tear Gas grenades and told us to take off our Gas Masks. WOW, talk about pain. I have read about how they do Water Boarding. If I had to do one or the other I'd pick Water Boarding. </UL>

<P><UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> You really need to put this all in perspective. If you are a terrorist and know where the big Atomic Bomb is hidden in one of our cities I will cheerfully pull your finger nails off to make you tell me where it is. Put it another way. Watch the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry" target="_blank">"Dirty Harry"</A>. I agree with Harry, do you?</UL><P>
 
 <LI> I will not "work together" to "take their oil."
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Take their oil? Exactly when and where did we do that? I wish we did. We always seem to pick up the bill for everyone else.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to get rid of common sense regulations on guns.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> All the big Democrat controlled cities have lots and lots of "Common Sense gun laws... and they don't work. All these cities, (you hear me Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland?) have disarmed the law abiding common citizen and are gun free zones. Criminals do not obey laws. Criminals like gun free zones where only criminals have guns for the first five to fifteen minutes, or longer, that it takes the Police to get there. I wonder how many people a criminal can kill in five minutes? Even with a revolver maybe three reloads of six each so 24? Armed citizens can cut that number to a possible <font size=5><B><U>ZERO</U></B></Font>. </UL><P>

<LI >I will not "work together" to eliminate the minimum wage.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Minimum wage sounds neat but instead hurts the very people it is supposed to help. In December, 1970 I was in advanced training, in the US Army, in Fort Ord California. I was getting about $115 a month. The wonderful Army decided to double my pay to around $225 a month. This happened on a Friday. The Thursday night before I bought a Taco at Taco Bell in town for 25 cents.  The next day, Friday, I went back to the same place expecting to buy a big pile of Tacos cheap. Imagine my surprise when I saw the Tacos were now 50 to 75 cents. Wow, they changed their menus fast. So all that extra money did me NO GOOD AT ALL.</UL>

<P><UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Extra money for work without an increase in the value of the work you do will not do you any good. A kid, with no real job skills (Show up on time, follow orders, work hard, work your best) who just wants a few bucks to spend is NOT WORTH top dollar. Force business owners to pay more then the employee produces results in bankruptcy. Businesses shut down and entry level jobs disappear. The price of Tacos goes up and your big pay raise does you no good at all. I really had my heart and stomach set on lots of tacos that night, didn't happen.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to support so-called "Right To Work" laws, or undermine, weaken or destroy Unions in any way.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> So you must be in a union to work? Even if you don't want to? Even if the union bosses spend your dues on politics and polices that you don't believe in? Isn't that called tyranny? What if the union you are in suddenly says we see the light and will now back President Trump with all of our union dues? Would you like being forced to be in that union? Is that fair?</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to suppress scientific research, be it on climate change, fracking, or any other issue where a majority of scientists agree that Trump and his supporters are wrong on the facts.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> What about <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1155054/pg1" target="_blank">Professor Dr. Judith Curry</A> and her views? How about <a href="http://www.omsj.org/corruption/climate-professor-quits-biased-global-warming-panel" target="_blank">Dutch Professor Richard Tol</A> and his views? It seems the <a href="http://www.omsj.org/issues/global-warming/doesnotcompute" target="_blank">Global Warming folks made a big Boo-Boo</A>. Oh, that's right <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/23/hundreds-scientists-urge-trump-withdraw-un-climate/" target="_blank">Climate Change</A>, also known as Weather. Fracking has been around since the <a href="http://aoghs.org/technology/hydraulic-fracturing/" target="_blank">Civil War days</A>. No problem then and no problems now. But you only believe the scientific research that you approve of. No facts need apply. No worry about the facts here. Ozone Al is giggling all the way to the bank.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to criminalize abortion or restrict health care for women.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> So killing 30 million girl babies because they are inconvenient is OK, huh? See my page on <a href="http://dansmc.com/abortion.htm" target="_blank">abortion deaths verses war deaths</A>. Abortion is murder any way you look at it. </UL><P>

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Does health care for women mean a free sex change operation for <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2017/02/27/im-sorry-but-caitlyn-jenner-is-a-man-wearing-a-dress-n2290986?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=" target="_blank">Caitlyn Jenner</a>? What if she changes her mind in a year or two? Changing her mind is a woman's prerogative, or so I'm told. But wait. She's already a man... or was... do we have to pay for her operation to change back 'cause now she's a woman or not 'cause he's already a man, or... ?" <B>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." </B>Genesis 1:27</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to increase the number of nations that have nuclear weapons.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> So I guess you are against the "Deal" Obama made with Iran giving them billions of dollars to make a nuclear bomb in ten years, right?</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to put even more "big money" into politics.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Sounds good to me. Keep the Clintons out of any kind of politics. Right on!</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to violate the Geneva Convention.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> As a paratrooper I always wondered about this so called Convention. You can't use hollow point bullets but you can use Napalm and flamethrowers. Huh?</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to give the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazi Party and white supremacists a seat at the table, or to normalize their hatred.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. Interesting how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_members_in_United_States_politics" target="_blank">Democrats and one or two Republicans</A> had dealings with these pigs in the past. Now everyone says they have changed and I believe them. I still agree. </UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to deny health care to people who need it.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. However, everyone should have the freedom to say no if they do not want it. Obamacare took that right away. Besides, almost all (Kinda, Sorta) <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/medicine/can-emergency-room-refuse-to-treat.htm" target="_blank">Emergency Rooms</A> in America give care regardless of if you can pay or not.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to increase the profits of the insurance companies.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree. There needs to be fair competition in health care across state lines. Currently the is no real competition at all in our health care system. Check out what this <a href="https://www.prnewschannel.com/2016/03/10/former-hospital-president-blows-whistle-on-predatory-u-s-healthcare-pricing/" target="_blank" target="_blank">Hospital Administrator</A> says. If you don't like this, sign the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/end-predatory-healthcare-pricing?source_location=minibar" target="_blank">Partition.</A></UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to deny medical coverage to people on the basis of an alleged or actual "pre-existing condition."
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> I agree.</UL><P>


<LI> I will not "work together" to increase voter suppression.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Voter Suppression? How about Voter Fraud. By law you have to be a Citizen to vote so every Citizen should have ID to vote. You have to have ID to get into any official meeting the Democrats have so why not have ID to vote? In California millions of Illegal Immigrants may have voted illegally. California operates on the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/01/experts-california-voter-registration-system-highly-susceptible-to-fraud.html" target="_blank">honor system</A> in voter registration. How honorable is someone who has already broken the law? We are slowly losing our rights as citizens.</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" to normalize tyranny.

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Say what? This whole rant, my friend, is you trying to be <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tyranny" target="_blank">Tyrannical</A>. Like the Snowflakes who block free speech on our collage campuses. You have not provided ANY logical arguments that support your side. Not even one. Yet if I disagree with you I am sexist, a racist, Islamophobic and evil. Isn't what you espouse the real Tyranny?</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" with anyone who is, or admires, tyrants and dictators.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Same as # 31</UL><P>

<LI> I will not "work together" with Donald Trump or anyone who supports him, because I will not allow one man to feed upon the fears of the populace, blaming minorities for their condition or their inability to thrive.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> So you say you will not work with me unless I obey you. Again, isn't that Tyranny? You feed on fear, other people's fear. You blame the irredeemable, deplorable people, who voted for someone you don't like, for all your troubles.</UL><P>

This is the line, and I am drawing it.
<P>
<LI> I will stand for honesty, love, respect for all living beings, and for the beating heart that is the center of Life itself.
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Love me, respect me but only if I agree with you. Respect for all living beings unless, of course, you are an inconvenient baby.</UL><P>

<LI> I will use my voice and my hands, to reach out to the uninformed, and to anyone who will LISTEN for what's really so dangerous about Donald Trump, his friends and the Big Lie they spin to the world:
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> You say you want to reach out but only if I agree with you first. Yet you give absolutely NO evidence as to why I am wrong and you are right. You only give progressive talking points. No when, no where, no how, no who, no nothings.  <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/02/06/16-fake-news-stories-reporters-have-run-since-trump-won/" target="_blank">"Fake News"</A> is news without truth or facts. So does that make an opinion without facts a Fake Opinion? How about <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/22/white-house-correspondents-question-shows-why-people-have-trouble-trusting-the-media/" target="_blank">Fake Racism</A>?</UL><P>

<LI> That "winning", "being great again", "rich" or even "beautiful" is anything more than nothing... When others are sacrificed to glorify its existence."
<BR>
<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Yes, you are sacrificing yourself by hating me. Good news is that I am still interested in your facts, if you have any. I can still be nice to you. I wonder if you hate hate enough to be nice to me.</UL>

<UL><font color=red size=5>&sect;</font><font size=4> Put it this way. We actually agree on a number of points. If you want your point of view to be heard you have to sit at the negotiation table. Come to the table and you will be fed.</UL>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
