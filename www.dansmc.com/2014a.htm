<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!

<BR><BR>
<font size=4>
<P>What is wrong with you people? Over the untold thousands of years of Human history Revolution after Revolution has come and gone like economic bubbles in our economy. They grow bigger and bigger, then POP with bloody results and great hope for the common people. The beautiful dream is always stolen by the people we've trusted. The politicians all promise the moon and deliver Hades.

<P>Everywhere the bubble has burst. The Communists in Russia, Eastern Europe, China, Cambodia. The Monarchists in Germany, France, Russia are only the most recent failures. The one place where the common man's Revolution has succeeded is here in the United States of America. Why? Because the common man and woman have bothered to participate in government by intelligently VOTING. At least until the age of Obama.

<P>You know, I've had a lot of liberal, dare I say progressive, friends. In the past we would enjoyably argue over how much we should help the poor. They would say we have to give money poor women with kids and it has to be enough so they will buy their kids food, clothes, cell phones and the like. But in the past we always assumed we would spend money we had. Now we spend money we borrow and then borrow some more. 

<P>What good has all this spending done us? Food stamp usage is way, way up. Poverty rates are up. Jobs and economic success for the common man are way, way down. 

<P>However, I notice the Wall Street folks who did good under the Republicans and President Bush are now doing absolutely FANTASTIC under the Democrats and President Obama. I ask the question "Are YOU doing good?" Maybe not so much.

<P>The reason is pretty obvious. All this free stuff is making us fat, lazy and unmotivated. The politicians have lied to us. Telling us anything they think we want to hear except the truth, so they can get reelected. Just follow the money. 

<P>If it sounds too good to be true, guess what, <B>IT'S NOT TRUE.</B> 

<P>All this stuff has been done right in front of your face and in past Blobs I've pointed out time and time again. Fast and Furious, IRS scandal, ObamaCare, Benghazi and you still voted President Obama back into office. Now we have NSA spying, VA scandal, Five Terrorist give away for a deserter. What will come next? Yet so many still think President Obama and the Democrats are the greatest. I have asked for years a simple question. If you disagree with me please tell my why. On what facts are you basing your disagreement.

<P> No one ever does tell me why. I get very few e-mails that think I am wrong. One guy said I was a mile wide and an inch deep but he gave no facts at all to back up his opinion. No facts, no reasons but you still vote these quack politicians back into office.

<P><B>WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?</B>

<P>We are going to get another chance in November. Are you going to be ready?

<P>Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Colonel Charles Yancey in 1816 wrote "If a nation expects to be ignorant -- and free -- in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be."

<P>I don't really care whether you are a Bleeding Heart Liberal or Penny pinching Conservative you have got to wake up Folks. You can't keep wasting money on garbage ideas and foolish plans that do not work. You have got to start studying the issues that are confronting our country and vote accordingly. The Republicans sent Trillions of dollars trying to make tribal people into Americans. It didn't work in Iraq and it is not working in Afghanistan. 

<P>It was a good thing we tried to do in both countries but As Winston Churchill said 115 years ago about Afghanistan:

<P>"The "Full steam ahead" method would be undoubtedly the most desirable. This is the military view. Mobilise, it is urged, a nice field force, and operate at leisure in the frontier valleys, until they are as safe and civilised as Hyde Park. Nor need this course necessarily involve the extermination of the inhabitants. Military rule is the rule best suited to the character and comprehension of the tribesmen. They will soon recognise the futility of resistance, and will gradually welcome the increase of wealth and comfort that will follow a stable government. Besides this, we shall obtain a definite frontier almost immediately. Only one real objection has been advanced against this plan. But it is a crushing one, and it constitutes the most serious argument against the whole "Forward Policy." It is this: we have neither the troops nor the money to carry it out." 

<P>Free prescription drugs, tax credits financed by deficit spending,  That is the Republican contribution to this economic mess. Well meaning but not that well thought out. 

<P>The Democratic contribution is worse. TARP, Solyndra, Carbon Credits, bailouts of all these Wall Street rich folks and Unions (Remember GM?), ObamaCare and who can forget all the scandals. Fast and Furious (One dead), IRS, NSA, the war on Journalists, Benghazi (Four Dead, do you see a trend developing?), VA. Now Iraq is blowing up and we actually considering joining the Iranians, who hate us, to help the Iraqs, who hate us. 

<P>Democratic Front runner Hilary says her Russian reset button error was actually the start of a successful foreign policy. Can you say Ukraine? In a recent interview she said she takes full responsibility for what happened except that it is not her fault because it was some one else's responsibility under her. She also still believes in that phony video. She did help a <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/dgreenfield/hillary-clinton-helped-child-rapist-get-off-attacked-12-year-old-victim/print/" target="_blank"> rapist of a twelve year old girl<a/> though. Got him a great deal. And people are actually going to vote for her?

<P><B>WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?</B>

<P>Is it any wonder I have high blood pressure? I will echo the words of Psalms 82:1-8

<center><P><font size=5><B>"God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. <BR>How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
<BR>Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. <BR>Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. <BR>They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: <BR>all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 
I have said, <BR>Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. <BR>But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 
<p>Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations."</B></font></center>


<P>Matthew Henry gives us an excellent take on these verses.

<P>An exhortation to judges. (1-5) The doom of evil rulers. (6-8)

<P>"#1-5 Magistrates are the mighty in authority for the public
good. Magistrates are the ministers of God's providence, for
keeping up order and peace, and particularly in punishing
evil-doers, and protecting those that do well. Good princes and
good judges, who mean well, are under Divine direction; and bad
ones, who mean ill, are under Divine restraint. The authority of
God is to be submitted to, in those governors whom his
providence places over us. But when justice is turned from what
is right, no good can be expected. The evil actions of public
persons are public mischiefs.

<P>#6-8 It is hard for men to have honour put upon them, and not to
be proud of it. But all the rulers of the earth shall die, and
all their honour shall be laid in the dust. God governs the
world. There is a righteous God to whom we may go, and on whom
we may depend. This also has respect to the kingdom of the
Messiah. Considering the state of affairs in the world, we have
need to pray that the Lord Jesus would speedily rule over all
nations, in truth, righteousness, and peace."

<P>I am not alone in my thinking. in a recent <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2014/06/10/the-prisoner-swap-deal-n1849497/page/full" target="_blank">Town Hall column Thomas Sowell</A> writes.

<P>"People who are disappointed with Barack Obama have no right to be. It is they whom others have a right to be disappointed with. Instead of taking their role as citizens seriously, they chose to vote on the basis of racial symbolism, glib rhetoric and wishful thinking.

<P>Moreover, many are already talking about choosing the next President of the United States on the basis of demographic symbolism -- to have "the first woman president." And if she is elected on that basis, will any criticism of what she does in the White House be denounced as based on anti-woman bias, as criticisms of President Obama have been repeatedly denounced as racism?"

<P><B>DO NOT</B> give up hope. Psalms 84:11-12 tells us:
<center><P><font size=5><B>" For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory:<BR> no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.<BR> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."</B></font></center>

<P>We must trust in the Lord but we must also do our God given duty. Why do I say that? If you study the history of our great nation it will become evident that God was central in our nation's birth. The Bible tells us that Jesus is Prophet, Priest and King. Some say that our three branches of government were made to mirror Christ, if only imperfectly. 
<OL>
<LI>Judicial=Prophet, they interpret the law.
<LI> Legislative=Priest, they make the laws. 
<LI>Presidential=King, he enforces the laws.
</OL>


<P>Accept it or not the way the United States Government is set up, while imperfect, is still the best government system in the world for the common man. We, obviously, will never even come close to equaling God but the USA is a better try then anywhere else in all of history and you have a big part in it.

<P>What difference, at this point, does it make? A lot.

<P>One of the basics of our country is the right to vote. What everyone forgets is that it is also a responsibility. When you vote foolishly, without looking at the issues, or vote strictly by emotion, well what do you think. Do you really think you will not be held responsible in some way, shape, or form? In the final analysis <B>YOU</B> are the real government leader and boss. 

<P>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times and you've got a Republican. Fool me a dozen times and baby, You got a progressive Democrat. Look at what your government leaders are doing <B>IN YOUR NAME.</B> Should not you shoulder at least some blame?

<P><B>WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?</B>

<P>Start doing your homework. Open your eyes and clean out your ears. Get your head out of your <a href="fourth_point.htm" target="_blank">forth point of contact</a> because the lack of oxygen is making you hallucinate.

<P>Study the people and issues and vote. Hold these foolish people, these politicians, to account. It is your duty and so much depends on it. The head terrorist in Iraq, one Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, said as we let him go," I'll  see you guys in New York." The same people who let him go now say we need to partner with Iran to stop him. So do you want to let them try again? Who knows, another trillion dollars and 10,000 of our soldiers dead, and it might work this time. Or not. Shouldn't our wounded veterans medical care come first? Maybe before we add thousands more wounded veterans?

<P>Again read what <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2014/06/17/a-bitter-aftertaste-n1852070/page/full"  target="_blank">Thomas Sowell says:</A>

<P>"Perhaps what was achieved in Germany and Japan made it seem that we might achieve something similar in Iraq. But "the greatest generation" that had fought and survived the horrors of war around the world was under no illusion that trying to turn our defeated enemies around would be easy, quick and cheap.

<P>Creating democracy in Germany and Japan was a goal, but not a fetish. Creating a stable and viable government amid the ruins and rubble of war was the first priority and a major responsibility. You cannot create instant democracy like you are making instant coffee.

<P>There are prerequisites for a free society, and the foundations of democracy cannot be built on chaotic conditions with widespread uncertainty and fear. To hold elections for the sake of holding elections is to abdicate responsibility for the sake of appearances.

<P>The biggest danger is that you will create a government that will work at cross purposes to everything you are trying to achieve -- a government you cannot rein in, much less repudiate, without destroying your own credibility as representatives of democracy. That has happened in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

<P>By contrast, in both Germany and Japan power was turned over to elected officials at such times and in such degree as conditions seemed to indicate. Eventually, both countries resumed their roles as sovereign nations. But we didn't publish a timetable.

<P>Today, with terrorists threatening to at least fragment Iraq, if not take it over, it is a sobering thought that Barack Obama and his key advisers have a track record of having been wrong about Iraq and other foreign policy issues for years, going back before they took office -- and no track record of learning from their mistakes. " 

<P>We tried a great thing in Iraq and Afghanistan. We tried to give them true freedom and they decided they did not want it. We failed. Mostly I believe from governmental bungling. Some may disagree and that is OK but the fact still remains we failed. It is time to let the chips fall where they may. It is time for the Iraqis and Afghans to stand or fall on their own. To those who say if Iraq falls we could have another 9-11 I say our boarders are even more leaky now then before 9-11. So the cure?

<center><P><font size=5><B>CLOSE OUR BORDERS!</B> Wow, that cures a lot of problems, does it not?</font></center>

President Obama said he would transform America and he is doing it. From a great economic powerhouse to a poor third world nation. But at least we will all be equal. Equally poor that is. He said he would do it in so many ways and yet you still voted for him and his big government cronies.

<P><B>WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?</B>

<P><a href="http://dansmc.com/info.htm" target="_blank">Start doing your home work.</A> If you don't, you just might find yourself with full employment in the US Army in the middle east wars (excuse me, Police Actions) when the government (either party, take your pick) brings back the draft. Think it will not happen? While I enlisted in the 82nd Airborne (an all volunteer outfit) back in 1971 I still had a draft number, #68. History does repeat itself at times. 

<P>Vote foolishly or don't vote at all and see what happens.

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
