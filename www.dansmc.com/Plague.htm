HE Coasts of the Levant being always
  suspected of the Plague, all
  Ships which come from thence for Marseilles stop at the Islands of
Chateaudif; and the Intendants of
  Health regulate the Time and Manner
  of their Quarantaines, and of purifying their
  Cargoes, by the Tenor of their Patents (or Bills of
  Health), and by the State of Health of the particular
  Places from whence they come.</p>
<p>The Beginning of May, 1720. we had Advice at Marseilles,
that from the Month of March the Plague
  was rife in most of the Maritime Towns or trading
  Ports of Palestine and Syria.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The 25th of the said Month of May, the Ship
  commanded by Captain Chataud, which came from
  thence, that is to say, from Sidon, Tripoli, Syria,
and Cyprus, arrives at the said Islands; but his Patents
  are clean (i.e. his Certificates imported there was
  no Contagion at those Places,) because he came away
  the 31st of January, before the Plague was there. He
  declares, however, to the Intendants of Health, that
  in his Voyage, or at Leghorn where he touched, Six
  Men of his Crew died, but he shews by the Certificate
  of the Physicians of Health at Leghorn, that
  they died only of Malignant Fevers, caused by unwholesome
  Provisions.</p>
<p>The 27th of May, one of his Sailors dies in his
  Ship.</p>
<p>The 28th, the Intendants cause the Corpse to be
  carried into the Infirmary; Guerard, chief Surgeon
  of Health, views it; and makes Report, that it has
  not any Mark of Contagion.</p>
<p>The 29th, the Intendants settle the purifying of
  the Goods of this Cargo, to Forty Days compleat, to
  be reckoned from the Day the last Bale shall be carried
  from it into the Infirmaries.</p>
<p>The last of May, Three other Vessels arrive at the
  same Islands; viz. Two small Vessels of Captain Aillaud's
  from Sidon, whence they came since the Plague
  was there; and Captain Fouque's Bark from Scanderoon.</p>
<p>The 12th of June, Captain Gabriel's Ship arrives
  there likewise from the same Places, with a foul Patent;
  (i.e. importing, that the Plague was there.)</p>
<p>The same Day the Officer, whom the Intendants
  had put on Board Captain Chataud's Ship to see Quarantain
  duly performed, dies there; Guerard chief
  Surgeon of Health views the Body, and makes Report
  that it has not any Mark of Contagion.</p>
<p>The 14th of June, the Passengers who came in the
  said Ship, are perfumed for the last Time in the Infirmaries;
  and are allowed to enter the City as usual.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>The 23d, being the Eve of St. John Baptist, the
  Grand Prior arrives at Genoa with the King's Gallies;
  the Sheriffs have the Honour to welcome him, and I
  to make a Speech to him in the Name of the City.</p>
<p>The same Day a Cabbin-Boy of Captain Chataud's
  Ship, a Servant employed at the Infirmaries in purifying
  the Goods of that Ship, and another who was purifying
  those of Captain Gabriel's Ship, fall sick; the same
  Surgeon makes Report that they have not any Mark of
  Contagion.</p>
<p>The 24th, another Servant employed to purify Captain Aillaud's Goods,
falls sick likewise; is visited, and
  the same Report made.</p>
<p>The 24th, and 26th, all Four dye one after another;
  their Bodies are viewed, and Report made that
  they have not any Mark of Contagion.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Reports thus made, the Intendants
  consult and resolve by way of Precaution to cause
  all these Bodies to be buried in Lime; to remove from
  the Island of Pomegu� the Ships of the Captains Chataud,
Aillaud, and Gabriel, and send them to a
  distant Island called Jarre, there to begin again their
  Quarantain; and to inclose the Yard where their
  Goods are purifying in the Infirmaries, without suffering
  the Servants employed to air them, to come
  out.</p>
<p>The 28th of June, another Vessel, being Captain Gueymart's Bark,
from Sidon, arrives at the foresaid
  Islands with a foul Patent.</p>
<p>The 1st of July, the Intendants pass a Resolution,
  to cause all the Vessels which were come with foul Patents,
  to Anchor at a good Distance off the Island of Pomegu�.</p>
<p>The 7th of July, two more Servants shut up to purify
  in the Infirmaries the Goods brought by Captain Chataud,
  fall sick; the Surgeon finds Tumours in their
  Groyns, and says in his Report that he does not believe
  however it is the Plague: He pays for his Incredulity,
  perhaps for not right understanding the Distemper, by
  dying himself soon after, with part of his Family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>The 8th, another Servant falls sick; the Surgeon
  finds a Swelling in the upper Part of the Thigh, and
  then declares he takes it to be a Mark of Contagion,
  and desires a Consultation.</p>
<p>Immediately the Intendants call three other Master
  Surgeons to visit the said Servants; their Report is, that
  they have all certainly the Plague.</p>
<p>The 9th those Patients dye, they are buried in Lime,
  and all their Apparel is burnt.</p>
<p>The Intendants resolve to cause all the Goods of Captain Chataud's Cargoe, to be taken out of the Infirmaries,
  and sent to be purified on the Island of Jarre;
  and they repair to the Town-House to acquaint the
  Sheriffs with what has passed.</p>
<p>The Matter appearing to be of Consequence, they
  write about it to the Council of Marine, and to the
  Marshal Duke de Villars, Governor of Provence;
  and M. Estelle, one of the chief Sheriffs, with two Intendants
  of Health, are deputed to go to Aix to give
  an Account of it to M. Lebret, first President of the
  Parliament and Intendant of Justice and of Commerce.</p>
<p>The same Day, M. Peissonel, and his Son, Physicians,
  come to the Town-House, to give Notice to the Sheriffs,
  that having been called to a House in the Square of Linche, to visit a young Man named Eissalene, he appeared
  to them to have the Plague.</p>
<p>That Instant, Guards are sent to the Door of that
  House, to hinder any one from coming out of it.</p>
<p>The 10th of July that Patient dies, and his Sister
  falls sick; the Guard is doubled; and it being judged
  proper to carry both off; to do it the more quietly,
  and without alarming the People, it is delayed till
  Night; when at Eleven a Clock M. Moustier, another
  of the chief Sheriffs, repairs thither without Noise,
  sends for Servants from the Infirmaries, encourages
  them to go up into the House, and they having brought
  down the Dead and the Sick, he orders them to carry
  them in Litters without the Town to the Infirmaries,
  causes all Persons belonging to the House to be conducted
  thither likewise, accompanies them himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> Guards, that none might come near them, and then returns
  to see the Door of the House closed up with
  Mortar.</p>
<p>The 11th Notice is given, that one Boyal is fallen
  sick in the same Quarter of the Town, Physicians and
  Surgeons are sent to visit him; they declare he has the
  Plague, his House is instantly secured by Guards, and
  when Night is come M. Moustier goes thither, sends
  for the Buriers of the Dead from the Infirmaries, and
  finding the Patient was newly dead, causes them to
  take the Corpse, accompanies it, sees it interred in
  Lime, and then returns to remove all the Persons of
  that House to the Infirmaries, and the Door to be closed
  up.</p>
<p>The 12th all this is told to the Grand Prior, who
  still remains at Marseilles; the first President is writ
  to; the Intendants of Health are assembled, to cause
  all the Vessels come from the Levant, with foul Patents,
  to go back to the Island of Jarre, and all their
  Goods that remain in the Infirmaries to be removed
  thither likewise: M. Audimar, one of the Sheriffs, presided
  in their Assembly, to influence them to pass this
  Resolution.</p>
<p>This, and the following Day, the Sheriffs make
  very strict Enquiry in the Town, to discover all Persons
  who had Communication with those Dead or Sick
  of the Plague; the most suspected are sent to the Infirmaries,
  and the others confined to their Houses.</p>
<p>The 14th, they write an Account of what has
  passed to the Council of Marine; they resolve not to
  give any more Patents (or Certificates of Health) to
  any Vessel, till they can be sure the Distemper is
  over.</p>
<p>The 15th, left from this Refusal to give Certificates
  of Health, it should be believed in foreign Countries
  that the plague is in Marseilles; and lest this should
  entirely interrupt all Commerce, they write to the
  Officers Conservators of Health at all the Ports of Europe, the real Fact; that is to say, That there are
  several Persons ill of the Contagion in the Infirma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ries,
  but that it has not made any Progress in the
  City.</p>
<p>The 21st of July, nothing of the Plague having
  since been discovered in the Town, they write it with
  Joy to the Council of Marine, and continue to provide
  whatever is necessary in the Infirmaries for the Subsistance
  of suspected Persons whom they have sent thither,
  and of those whom they have confined to their
  Houses.</p>
<p>Already the Publick, recovered from their Fright,
  begin to explode as useless the Trouble the Sheriffs had
  given themselves, and all the Precautions they had taken;
  'tis pretended, the Two Persons who died in
  the Square of Linche, were carried off by quite another
  Distemper than the Plague: The Physicians and
  Surgeons are upbraided with having by their Error allarmed
  the whole Town. Abundance of People are
  observed to assume the Character of a dauntless Freedom
  of Mind, who are soon after seen more struck
  with Terror than any others, and to fly with more
  Disorder and Precipitation; their boasted Firmness
  quickly forsakes them. The Truth is, the Plague is
  to be feared and shunned.</p>
<p>The 26th of July, Notice is given to the Sheriffs,
  that in the Street of Lescalle, a Part of the old Town
  inhabited only by poor People, Fifteen Persons are
  suddenly fallen sick: They dispatch thither Physicians
  and Surgeons; they examine into the Distemper,
  and make Report; some, that 'tis a Malignant
  Fever; others, a contagious or pestilential Fever, occasioned
  by bad Food, which Want had long forced
  those poor Creatures to live upon: Not one of them
  says positively it is the Plague. A Man must indeed
  have been very well assured of it, to say it; the Publick
  had already shewed a Disposition to resent any
  false Alarm.</p>
<p>The Sheriffs do not rest wholly satisfied with this
  Report, but resolve to proceed in the same Way of
  Precaution, as if those Sick were actually touched with
  the Plague; to send them all without Noise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> Infirmaries; and for the present to confine them in
  their Houses.</p>
<p>The 27th, Eight of those Sick dye; the Sheriffs
  themselves go to their Houses to cause them to be searched;
  Buboes are found on Two of them: The Physicians
  and Surgeons still hold the same Language, and
  impute the Cause of the Distemper to unwholsome
  Food. Notwithstanding which, as soon as Night
  comes, M. Moustier repairs to the Place, sends for
  Servants from the Infirmaries, makes them willingly
  or by Force, take up the Bodies, with all due Precautions;
  they are carried to the Infirmaries, where they
  are buried with Lime; and all the rest of the Night
  he causes the remaining Sick, and all those of their
  Houses, to be removed to the Infirmaries.</p>
<p>The 28th, very early in the Morning, Search is made
  every where for those who had Communication with
  them, in order to confine them: Other Persons in the
  same Street fall sick, and some of those who first
  sicken'd dye. At Midnight M. Estelle (who was come
  back from Aix) repairs thither; causes the Buriers of
  the Dead at the Infirmaries to attend; makes them
  carry off the dead Bodies, and bury them in Lime;
  and then till Day-break sees all the Sick conducted to
  the Infirmaries.</p>
<p>The People who love to deceive themselves, and will
  have it absolutely not to be the Plague, urge a Hundred
  false Reasons on that Side. Would the Plague,
  say they, attack none but such poor People? Would
  it operate so slowly?</p>
<p>Let them have but a few Days Patience, and they
  will see all attacked without Distinction, with the
  swiftest Rage, and the most dreadful Havock, that ever
  was heard of.</p>
<p>Some obstinately contend that the Distemper proceeded
  wholly from Worms: But while they pretend to argue
  so confidently, trembling with Fear in their Hearts,
  they make up their Pack to be the readier to fly:
  What all others are doing, I leave to be imagined;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> every one has taken the Fright, and is ready to run
  out of the Town, to seek Refuge any where.</p>
<p>In the mean while, the Distemper continuing in
  the Street of Lescalle, the 29th of July, and 10 Days
  after successively, the Sheriffs are obliged to give
  Nightly the same Attendance, and in the Daytime
  to make continual Search after all those who had
  Communication with the Sick or Dead: People fall sick
  in several other Parts of the Town; they are confined
  in Places by themselves by Guards; some of them Dye,
  and every Night M. Estelle and Moustier, go by Turns
  to see them carried off, to remove the rest to the Infirmaries,
  and to fasten up or perfume Houses; Labours
  as dangerous as toilsome, especially when after having
  sat up and staid all Night in the Street, they find themselves
  obliged to apply all the Day after to a thousand
  other Things no less troublesome.</p>
<p>M. Audimar and Dieud�, the other Sheriffs, are fatigued
  on their part with continual Care and Pains,
  arising from the Increase of necessary Business in a
  Town, where the common Course of Occurrences takes
  up all the Time the Civil Magistrate can bestow.
  M. Dieud�, however, goes two Nights together, to
  accompany the Officers at removing the Dead and the
  Sick.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Pilles, the Governor, is perpetually
  co-operating with them all; he is every Day, from
  Morning till Night, at the Town-House, applying
  himself indefatigably to all that his Zeal and Prudence
  suggest to him; and to all that the maintaining of
  good Order requires on such an Occasion.</p>
<p>The whole Sum in Specie at this time in the City-Treasury,
  is but 1100 Livres; and 'tis manifest, that if
  the City come to be thoroughly infected, all must perish
  for Want of Money: This obliges the Sheriffs to write
  to the First President, to press him earnestly to be pleased
  to procure Money for them.</p>
<p>Bread-Corn being scarce, is immediately run up to
  an exorbitant Price; to prevent therefore its being
  hoarded up to make it dearer, an Ordinance is issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> at my Instance, to forbid the hoarding it, on severe Penalties.
  Two other Ordinances are published at the
  same time, forbidding all Persons to have and keep in
  the Town, any thing that might contribute to the spreading
  of the Contagion.</p>
<p>The 30th of July, a general View and Inventory is
  taken of all the Provisions in the City; and the Sheriffs
  finding hardly any Bread-Corn, Meat, or Wood,
  and little Money in the Treasury to buy Stores with;
  all things excessively dear; Disorder increasing; the Populace
  as poor as frighten'd; all the Persons of Condition
  and the Rich already fled: They write to M. le
  Pelletier des Forts, and representing to him the deplorable
  Condition of Marseilles, beseech him to intercede
  with his Royal Highness to grant them some
  Supplies.</p>
<p>The 31st of July, another Ordinance is issued at my
  Instance, to oblige all strange Beggars to depart the
  City this Day; and those settled in the Town, to retire
  into the Hospital de la Charit�, on the Penalty of being
  whipped.</p>
<p>But this Ordinance is not put in Execution, because
  we learn the same Day, that the Chamber of Vacations of the Parliament of Aix, on the Rumour that the
  Plague is in Marseilles, has publish'd an Arr�t, forbidding
  the Marseillians to stir out of the Bounds of
  their own Territory; the Inhabitants of all the Towns
  and Places of Provence to communicate with them, or
  to harbour them; and all Muleteers, Carriers, and all
  others, to go to Marseilles, for what Cause, or under
  what Pretext soever, on Pain of Death.</p>
<p>In this Condition, how could 2 or 3000 Beggars,
  that were then in the City, be turned out of it? Not
  being able to pass beyond the Limits of the Territory,
  they would be constrained to stay there, and to ravage
  it for Subsistance.</p>
<p>The 1st of August, M. Sicard, Father and Son,
  Physicians, come to the Town-House, to tell the Sheriffs,
  that it is not to be doubted the Distemper in the
  City is really the Plague, but that they make sure Ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>count
  they shall put an end to it, if they will do what
  they shall prescribe; which is to buy up a great Quantity
  of Wood, Brushes and Faggots; to lay them
  in Piles, at small Distances, along the Walls of
  the Town, and in all publick Walks, open Places,
  Squares, and Markets; to oblige every private
  Person to lay a Heap of them before his House, in all
  the Streets in general; and to set them all on fire at
  the same time, in the Beginning of the Night; which
  will most certainly put an End to the Plague.</p>
<p>Every body being willing to make this Experiment;
  and all the other Physicians, who are called daily to the
  Town-House to give an Account of the Progress of the
  Distemper, not disapproving it; the Sheriffs forthwith
  cause all the Wood, Faggots, and Brushes that
  can be found, to be bought up; and M. Audimar and Dieud� go with the utmost Ardour to see them placed
  along the Walls, and in the publick Walks and
  Places.</p>
<p>The 2d of August they publish an Ordinance, commanding
  all the Inhabitants to make each a Bonfire before
  his House, and to light it at 9 a-Clock at Night,
  the Moment those along the Walls and in the publick
  Places shall be lighted. This is executed: It is a magnificent
  Sight, to behold a Circuit of Walls, of so large,
  so vast Extent, all illuminated; and if this should cure
  the City, it would certainly be cured in a most joyful
  and agreeable manner.</p>
<p>The Magistrates, who to satisfy the Publick, and to
  avoid all Reproach, make such Experiments, cannot
  however sleep upon the Success promised from them;
  Prudence requires they should pursue proper Measures,
  and not be with-held by vain Hopes: They write to
  the First President, and desire him, since the Roads are
  barricaded against them, to be pleased to dispatch for
  them a Courier to the Court, to represent their Misery,
  and the Inconveniences they have ground to fear, as
  being without a Penny of Money, while they are in
  Dread of wanting every thing, and of having the
  Calamity of Famine superadded to that of the Plague.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>They write to the Council of Marine likewise, acquainting
  them what Number of Sick they actually
  have, and how many Dead they have carried to, and
  buried at the Infirmaries.</p>
<p>The same Day, in the Assembly held daily at the
  Town-House with the municipal Officers, and such of
  the chief Citizens as have not yet fled, M. de Pilles presiding, it was resolved:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>1. That whereas the Number of the Sick increases
    more and more, especially in the Street of Lescalle,
    a Corps de Garde shall be posted at every Avenue of
    that street, to hinder any one's going into, or coming
    out of it; and that Commissaries of Victualling shall
    be appointed to go and distribute Provisions to the Families
    inhabiting that Street.</p>
  <p>2. That all the Captains of the City shall each raise
    a Company of 50 Men of the Militia, to be paid by
    the City: And that however, the Five Brigades called
    the Brigades du Privilege du Vin, with their Officers, shall
    serve every where as a Guard to the Sheriffs in their
    Marches in the Night, to see the Dead and Sick carry'd
    off to the Infirmaries.</p>
  <p>3. That the Physicians and Surgeons already employ'd,
    may be induced to serve with the greater Diligence,
    and not to demand any fee of the Sick, they
    shall have Salaries from the City, and be allowed Sarrots of oiled Cloth, and Chairs, for their more easy
    Conveyance every where.</p>
  <p>4. That seeing the City has no Money, and that it
    must indispensibly be had, Advertisements shall be publickly
    affixed, for taking Loans of Money at 5 per Cent. to try to get some by that means: And that the Treasurer
    not being able to come to reside at the Town-House,
    M. Bouys, First Clerk of the Records, shall be
    Cashier there.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>The 3d of August, the Marquess de Pilles, and the
  Sheriffs, being reassembled with the same Citizens, appoint
  150 Commissaries in the 5 Parishes of the City,
  to look each in the Quarter assigned him to the Wants
  of the Poor; to distribute to them Bread, and other
  Subsistance, at the Charge of the City; and to do
  whatever else they shall be directed for the publick
  Good and Welfare.</p>
<p>In that Part of the Town called the Rive Neuve,
  which lies beyond the Port, and extends from the Abbey
  of St. Victor to the Arsenal, the Chevalier Rose is
  appointed Captain and Commissary General.</p>
<p>And in the Territory, (i.e. the Country belonging
  to Marseilles) which is like a vast City, there being
  above Ten thousand Houses, called Bastides, in the 44
  Quarters and dependent Parishes, of which it is composed,
  besides several pretty large Villages; one Captain
  and some Commissaries are appointed for each, to take
  the like Care.</p>
<p>The same Day, for preventing Communication among
  Children, who, as it is said, are most susceptible of the
  Plague, the College and all the Publick Schools are shut up.</p>
<p>As for the Fires advised by the Two Sicards, they
  are forborn: Notice is given, that those Two Physicians
  have deserted the City; besides, there is no Wood,
  Faggots, or Brushes, to be had; but a Quantity of
  Brimstone is bought up, and distributed among the
  Poor, in all Quarters of the Town, and the Insides of
  all the Houses are order'd to be perfumed.</p>
<p>In the Evening, the Marquis de Pilles and the Sheriffs,
  being still assembled in the Town-House, Notice
  is given them, that four or five Hundred of the Populace
  are got together in the Quarter called l'Aggrandissement,
  and are very disorderly, crying out they
  will have Bread; the Bakers of that Quarter, by reason
  of the Scarcity of Corn, not having made the usual
  Quantity, so that many Persons could not be served:
  The Marquess de Pilles and M. Moustier hasten thither,
  followed by some Guards; their Presence puts a Stop
  to the Tumult, and they entirely appease the People,
  by causing some Bread to be given them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The 4th, the Officers of the Garison of Fort St. John come to the Town-House, acquaint the Sheriffs that
  they are in want of Bread-Corn, and desire a Supply
  from them; declaring, that otherwise they cannot answer
  that the Troops of their Garison will not come into
  the City, and take Corn by Force. The Sheriffs reply,
  that they would willingly furnish them if they had
  Stores sufficient; but the Want themselves are in, is so
  great, that they cannot do it; and if Violence should
  be offered to the Inhabitants, they would appear at
  their Head to defend them.</p>
<p>The same Day it being taken into Consideration,
  that the Arr�t issued by the Chamber of Vacations,
  having interdicted all Communication between the Inhabitants
  of the Province, and those of Marseilles; if
  Things should remain at this Pass, and no Body should
  bring in Corn, and other Provisions, we should soon
  be reduced to the Extremity of Famine, the Sheriffs
  resolve to have Recourse to the First President. Accordingly
  they send to intreat him to establish, as had
  been done formerly, Markets, and Barriers for Conference,
  at certain proper Places, whither Strangers,
  without being exposed to any Risque, might bring
  us Provisions: At the same time they write to
  the Procurators of the Country of Provence, to be
  pleas'd to concur therein. It is impossible, certainly,
  to exert more Compassion to the Miseries of
  an afflicted City, than they did; and particularly the
  Consuls of the several Towns: Marseilles will never
  forget the Services done her in this Calamity, nor the
  Kindness, Zeal and Readiness with which they were done.</p>
<p>The same Day, the Sheriffs considering the Disorders
  which often happen in a Time of Contagion, the
  Necessity of using speedy Means to suppress them, and
  of making Examples of Malefactors and Rebels; and
  that as often as this City has been visited with the
  Plague, as in 1580, 1630, 1649, and 1650, our Kings
  have constantly granted to their Predecessors in the
  Magistracy, by Letters Patents, the Power of judging all
  Crimes finally, and without Appeal; they write again
  to the First President, desiring him to procure for them
  from his Majesty the like Letters Patents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>The 5th, they repeat their Instances to him, to get
  them supplied with Corn: They write likewise to the
  same purpose, to the Consuls of Toulon, and to those
  of all the Maritime Towns of the Coasts of Languedoc and Provence; proposing to go to receive the Corn
  at any Place distant from the Town which they shall
  chuse to land it at; and they desire those of the Town
  of Martignes to send Vessels to Arles, to fetch Corn
  from thence.</p>
<p>The 6th, an Ordinance is publish'd at my Instance,
  forbidding all Persons to remove from one House to
  another the Moveables and Apparel of the Sick or Dead,
  or to touch them, or make any use of them, on Pain of
  Death. Another Ordinance fixes the Rates of Victuals
  and necessary Commodities, to restrain the excessive
  Price to which, because of the Scarcity, those who
  would make Advantage of the Publick Misery, would
  raise them.</p>
<p>The 7th, the Chamber of Vacations having permitted
  the Procurators of the Country to come to a Conference
  with the Sheriffs, at a Place on the Road to Aix,
  call'd Notre-Dame, two Leagues distant from Marseilles;
  the Marquess de Vauvenargues, first Procurator
  of the Country, comes thither, accompanied by several
  Gentlemen, and the principal Officers of the Province,
  attended by the Marshal de Villars's Guards, and by a
  Brigade of Archers of the Marshalsea. A Town
  afflicted with, or suspected of the Plague, out of
  which even almost all the Inhabitants are ready to
  run, cannot make a Figure, conformable to such
  Honour. M. Estelle, one of the chief Sheriffs,
  goes to the Place, without Retinue, without Attendants,
  and without any Guard, accompanied only
  by M. Capus, Keeper of the Records of the City, who,
  by his Ability, Probity, and Application, is become the
  Pilot, as it were, of this whole Community.</p>
<p>At this Conference, where the Precaution is used to
  speak to each other at a great Distance, an Agreement
  is made, importing, that at that Place a Market shall
  be establish'd, where a double Barrier shall be fixed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> and that another Market shall be settled at the Sheep-Inn,
  on the Road to Aubagne, which is likewise two
  Leagues from Marseilles; another for Vessels bringing
  Provisions by Sea, at a Creek called Lestaque, in the
  Gulph of the Islands of Marseilles; and that at all
  these Markets and Barriers, the Guards shall be placed
  by the Procurators of the Country, and paid by the
  Sheriffs of Marseilles.</p>
<p>The 8th, this Agreement is confirm'd by an Arret
  of the Chamber of Vacations: In Consequence of
  which, the Sheriffs write to all the Consuls of the Towns
  and Places of Provence, pressing them to send, with all
  Expedition, Corn, and other Provisions, Wood and
  Coal, to these Markets and Barriers, where all shall be
  transacted without Communication.</p>
<p>They apply themselves the same Day to the drawing
  up of general Instructions, in which they specify all
  the Duties the Commissaries whom they have already
  appointed, are to perform, for relieving the Poor, and
  taking Care of the Sick.</p>
<p>In the mean time, it being evident that M. Estelle and Moustier, who hitherto have sat up by Turns every
  Night, to see the Dead, Sick, and Suspected, carried
  to the Infirmaries, and Houses fasten'd up or perfumed,
  cannot possibly undergo such Fatigues much longer;
  especially the Distemper beginning to break out in divers
  Quarters of the Town, far distant from each other;
  altho' M. Audimar and Dieud� offer'd to relieve them;
  The Marquis de Pilles judging it necessary they should
  manage their Health and Life, it was resolved in the
  Assembly,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>1. That Carts shall be used to carry off the Dead;
    that all the sturdiest Beggars who can be found, shall
    be seized, and made Buriers of the Dead; that Four
    Lieutenants of Health shall direct them, and M. Bonnet,
    Lieutenant to the Governor, shall command
    them.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
  <p>2. Men shall forthwith be set to work, to dig large
    and deep Pits without the Walls of the Town, in which
    the Dead shall be buried with Lime.</p>
  <p>3. A Pest-House or Hospital shall be immediately
    establish'd: The Hospital de la Charit� is first thought
    of; but the Difficulty of removing out of it, and lodging
    elsewhere, above 800 of both Sexes who are in it,
    renders it necessary to resolve upon that des Convalescens,
    which is near the Walls of the Town, on the side
    of the Gate of St. Bernard du Bois.</p>
</div>
<p>The 9th of August, it is observ'd, that some Physicians,
  and almost all the Master-Surgeons, are fled.
  An Ordinance is issued at my Instance, to oblige them
  to return; on the Penalty to the former, of being expell'd
  for ever from the College of their Faculty; and
  to the latter, of being expell'd the Company of Surgeons,
  and of being proceeded against extraordinarily.</p>
<p>Another Ordinance is publish'd at my Instance, forbidding
  Butchers, when they flea and cut up Beef or
  Mutton at the Slaughter-House, to blow it up with
  their Mouth, by which the Plague might be communicated
  to the Meat; but to make use of Bellows, on
  Pain of Death.</p>
<p>Another, forbidding Bakers to convert into Biscuit,
  the Meal the City gives them to make Bread of for
  the Poor; or to make any White Bread, in order to
  prevent their bolting the Meal designed for the Poor's
  Bread.</p>
<p>And another, forbidding all Persons to divert the
  publick Waters for overflowing their Grounds; that
  the Conduits may not become dry, but that Water
  may run the more plentifully through all the Streets of
  the City to carry off the Filth.</p>
<p>This Day and the following, it is found not a little
  difficult, to get all that had been resolved upon the Day
  before put in Execution: Carts, Horses, Harness are
  wanted; they must be had from the Country, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> Person will furnish them to serve to carry infected
  Bodies. Men are wanted to harness the Horses, to put
  them to the Carts, and to drive them; and every one
  abhors lending a Hand to so dangerous a Service. Buriers
  of the Dead are wanted to take them out of the
  Houses; and tho' excessive Pay be offered, the poorest
  of the Populace dread such hazardous Work, and make
  all possible Efforts to shun it. Peasants are wanted to
  open the Pits, and none will come to dig, such Affright
  and Horror has seiz'd them: The Sheriffs are
  oblig'd to exert themselves to the utmost, to get some
  by Management, and others by Force and Rigor.</p>
<p>To put into Order as speedily as is requisite, a Pest-House,
  and to furnish it with all Necessaries, which
  are almost numberless, is a Task no less perplexed with
  Difficulties. The Hospital des Convalescens, which
  was resolved to be made use of, is found to be too
  little; it is necessary to enlarge it, by joining to it
  a Building called the Fas, which stands very near it;
  a thousand Things are to be done, and yet none could
  easily be made to stir about them: M. Moustier is
  obliged to repair thither, and to abide upon the Spot;
  and by keeping Hands at Work Night and Day, he
  makes such Expedition, that in 48 Hours he gets it
  put in Order, all Necessaries sorted and laid ready,
  and the whole made fit to receive the Sick.</p>
<p>A very great Difficulty still remains, which is to
  find Stewards, Overseers, Cooks, and other lower
  Officers, and especially so great a Number of Servants
  as are requisite to tend the Sick: Advertisements are
  affixed throughout the City, to invite those sordid
  Creatures whom Avarice draws into Dangers, or those
  of better Minds, whom superabundant Charity disposes
  to devote themselves for the Publick; and by seeking
  such out, by encouraging, giving, and promising,
  they are procured: Apothecaries and Surgeons
  are engaged; and two Physicians, Strangers, named Gayon, come in voluntarily, and offer their Service,
  and to be shut up in the Hospital: Unhappily, Death
  puts an End too soon to their Charity and Zeal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>Three Pits of Sixty Foot long, as many broad, and
  Twenty four deep, are begun at once without the
  Walls, between the Gate of Aix and that of Joliette:
  To compel the Peasants to work at them, M. Moustier is obliged to keep with them daily, exposed to the
  Heat of the Sun.</p>
<p>The Chevalier Rose, appointed Captain and Commissary-General
  at the Rive Neuve, beyond the Port,
  does the same: He puts into proper Order another
  vast Hospital, under the Sheds of a Rope-yard; causes
  large and deep Pits to be dug near the Abbey of
  St. Victor; gets together Carts, Buriers of the Dead,
  and all Persons needful to look to the Living, the Dying,
  and the Dead; and what is no less remarkable than
  his Activity, his Courage, and his Zeal for his unfortunate
  Country, he furnishes out of his own Purse the
  great Expences necessary for maintaining that Hospital,
  and the many Hands he employs, without troubling
  himself when and how he shall be reimbursed.</p>
<p>No sooner are these Pest-Houses in any Readiness
  to receive the Sick, but in less than Two Days they
  are quite filled; but are not long so by those who are
  carried thither: The Distemper is so violent, that
  those who are brought in at Night are carried out
  next Day to the Pits; and so the Dead make Room
  every Day successively for the Sick.</p>
<p>The 12th of August, M. de Chicoyneau and Verny,
  the chief Physicians of Montpellier, arrive at the Barrier
  of Notre-Dame, to come and examine, by Order
  of his Royal Highness, the true Nature of the Distemper
  that afflicts this City: Lodgings are made ready
  for them, and a Coach is sent to bring them hither from
  the Barrier.</p>
<p>The 13th, the Marquess de Pilles, and the Sheriffs
  invite them to the Town-House, whither they had
  summoned all the Physicians and Master-Surgeons of
  the City; after they had conferred a long Time upon
  the Symptoms of the Distemper, they agree among
  themselves, to go together the following Days, to visit
  as well the sick in the Hospitals, as those in the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> Quarters of the Town, and to make such Experiments
  as they should judge proper.</p>
<p>Hitherto the Distemper has not exerted all its Rage;
  it kills indeed those it seizes, hardly one escaping; and
  whatever House it enters, it carries off the whole Family;
  but as yet, it has fallen only on the poorer Sort
  of People, which keeps many Persons in a false Notion,
  that it is not really the Plague, but proceeds from
  bad Diet and Want of other Necessaries: those who
  use the Sea, and have frequently seen the Plague in the Levant, think they observe some Difference: In short,
  Abundance of People still remain in doubt, and expecting
  with the utmost Impatience the Decision of the
  Physicians of Montpellier, to determine them whether
  to stay or fly.</p>
<p>The 14th, the Sheriffs write to the Council of Marine,
  most humbly to thank his Royal Highness for
  his Care and Goodness, in sending to them these
  Physicians.</p>
<p>The 15th they write to the Marshal de Villars, to
  acquaint him with the Condition of the City, and the
  extreme Want it is in, having near a hundred thousand
  Souls in it, without Bread and without Money: they
  write likewise to M. de Bernage, Intendant in Languedoc,
  and to the Marquess de Caylus the commanding
  Officer in Provence, then at Montpellier, to desire them
  to procure them Bread-Corn, to preserve them from
  Famine, which they had no less Reason to fear than
  the Plague. The Marquess de Caylus has the Goodness
  to engage his own Credit for procuring them a good
  Quantity.</p>
<p>The 16th being the Festival of St. Roch, which has
  at all Times been solemnized at Marseilles, for imploring
  Deliverance from the Plague, the Marquess de
  Pilles, and the Sheriffs, for preventing Communication,
  would have the Procession usually made every Year, in
  which the Bust and Relicks of that Saint are carried, be
  now forborn; but they are obliged to yield to the Outcries
  of the People, who become almost raving in
  Matters of Devotion, when they are under so terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> a Scourge as the Plague, whose dire Effects they already
  feel; they even judge it convenient to assist at the Procession
  themselves, with all their Halbardiers and
  Guards, to hinder its being followed by a Crowd, and
  to prevent all Disorder.</p>
<p>The 17th the Physicians of Montpellier come to the
  Town-House, to acquaint the Sheriffs with what they
  have discover'd of the Nature of the Distemper, and in
  plain Words declare it to be certainly the Plague.</p>
<p>But considering how many People have already
  left the City, and that the Terror and Affright in
  it have put all into Confusion, they think fit, lest
  they should increase it, to dissemble; and that, for
  quieting Peoples Minds, a publick Notification should
  be affixed; importing, that they find the Distemper
  to be only a contagious Fever, occasion'd by
  unwholsome Diet, and that it will soon cease by
  the Supplies which are preparing to be sent in from
  all Parts, and which will produce Plenty of all Things.</p>
<p>This Notification is forthwith affixed, but without
  any Effect: The Mortality which for some Days past
  has extremely increas'd, the Malignity and Violence
  with which it begins to rage in all Parts without Distinction,
  and the Suddenness with which it is observ'd
  to communicate it self imperceptibly, has already
  convinced the most obstinate, and those who
  were most disposed to deceive themselves, that it is
  really the Plague; and without waiting to hear or
  reason any longer, every one runs away so precipitately,
  that all the Gates of the Town are hardly sufficient
  to let out the Crowds.</p>
<p>Were those only the useless Mouths, nothing could
  be more convenient and beneficial; but the most necessary
  Persons, and even those whose Functions oblige
  them most indispensably to tarry, are the forwardest
  to desert; almost all the Intendants of Health, those
  of the Office of Plenty, the Councellors of the Town,
  the Commissaries de Police, the chief Director of the
  Hospitals and other Houses of publick Charity; the
  very Commissaries, who but a few Days ago, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> established in the Parishes and Quarters to take care of
  relieving the Poor; the Tradesmen of all Professions,
  and those who are the most necessary in Life, the Bakers,
  the Sellers of Provisions and common Necessaries;
  even those whose Duty it is to watch others, and hinder
  them from leaving the Town; that is to say, the
  Captains and Officers of the Militia, do all desert,
  abandon, and fly from the City: In short, the
  Marquis de Pilles, and the Sheriffs are left by themselves,
  with the Care upon them of an infinite Number
  of poor People, ready to attempt any Thing in the
  Extremity to which they are reduced by Want, and by
  the Calamities which are multiplied by the Contagion.</p>
<p>The Town has now an Aspect that moves Compassion;
  an Air of Desolation appears throughout; all
  the Shops are every where shut up; the greatest Part of
  the Houses, Churches and Convents, all the publick
  Markets and Places of Resort are deserted; and no
  Person is to be found in the Streets, but poor groaning
  Wretches; the Port is empty, the Gallies have
  withdrawn from the Keys, and are enclosed within a
  Stockade on the Side of the Arsenal, where the
  Bridges are drawn up, and high Barriers erected, and
  all the Merchant-Ships and Vessels have left the Wharfs,
  and gone out to Anchor at a Distance.</p>
<p>This proud Marseilles, but a few Days before so
  flourishing; this Source of Plenty, and (if I may use
  the Expression) of Felicity; is become the true Image
  of Jerusalem in its Desolation: Happy still if it could
  stop here; and if the Hand which has begun to chastise
  her, did not within less than Two Weeks, render
  her the most dreadful Scene of human Misery,
  that ever Destruction formed in any City of the
  World.</p>
<p>The 18th, a Crowd of People from the Quarter of
  St. John come before the Gates of the Town-House,
  crying out that they will have Wine; and that there
  is no body left in the Town who will sell any. The
  Guards make ready to drive them away, M. Estelle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> repairs thither, and soon after M. Moustier; they pacify
  them, promise to let them have what they desire;
  and accordingly an Ordinance is immediately published,
  commanding all those who have Wine by them,
  to expose it to Sale all that Day, otherwise their
  Cellars to be broke open, and the Wine sold by the
  Guards, who shall go the Rounds through all the
  Quarters.</p>
<p>At this Time the Contagion has spread into all
  Parts of the Town, notwithstanding all the Care and
  Pains taken to hinder Communication, and begins to
  make a general Ravage: It is necessary for carrying off
  the Dead, to employ in the Streets a greater Number
  of Carts, and especially to increase the Number of Buriers
  of the Dead.</p>
<p>But this is utterly impossible, almost all of that Sort
  of People of the Town that could be sacrificed in so
  dangerous a Work are consumed; they do not live
  in it above Two Days; they catch the Plague the first
  Corpse they touch, whatever Precaution is used; they
  are furnished with Hooks fastened to the End of long
  Staves; but the coming any thing near the Bodies infects
  them: They are paid no less than Fifteen Livres
  a Day; but as alluring a Bait as that is to beggarly
  Wretches, they will not touch it, in the Sight of certain
  and inevitable Death; they must be hunted for,
  and dragged to the Work by downright Force: Now
  whether they are able to keep themselves hid, or whether
  they are all dead, there are no longer any to be
  found; in the mean while, the dead Bodies remain
  in the Houses, and at the Gates of the Hospitals, cast
  in Heaps one upon another, there being no Means to
  remove them and bury them in the Pits.</p>
<p>In this Extremity the Sheriffs have recourse to the
  Officers commanding the Gallies, most earnestly beseeching
  them to let them have some of their Slaves
  to serve for Buriers of the Dead, offering them Security
  for supplying their Room at the Cost of the City,
  or to make the Loss good to his Majesty. They condescend,
  considering the absolute Necessity, to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> them Twenty Six of their Invalids, to whom they promise
  Liberty to excite them to the Work.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the City was in some Measure
  saved by the Help of these Slaves, and of those
  afterwards granted, but it must be allowed too, that
  to Sheriffs who are oppress'd with the Weight of Business,
  and deserted by all Persons on whom they could
  repose any Part of their Care, such Buriers of the
  Dead are very burdensome.</p>
<p>They are destitute of all Necessaries; they must be
  provided with Shooes when there are neither Shooes
  nor a Shooemaker left in the City: They must have
  Lodgings and Victuals, and no body will harbour, or
  come near, or have any Communication with Gally-Slaves,
  Buriers of infected Bodies: A watchful Eye must
  be kept over them Night and Day; they rob all Houses
  from whence they fetch the dead Bodies; and not
  knowing how to harness the Horses, or drive the
  Carts, they often overturn them, breaking the Carts
  or the Harness, which cannot be mended, not only
  because there is neither Wheelwright nor Collarmaker
  left, but because no body will touch Things infected;
  so that the Sheriffs must be continually begging
  or borrowing of Carts from the Country, where
  every Body contrives to hide them; and must often
  be at a Stand in a Work requiring the most Haste of
  all others, which those Slaves affect to perform so
  slowly and lazily, that it is very provoking.</p>
<p>In what City of the World was it ever seen, that
  the Consuls were harrassed with so many Cares, and
  reduced to the Necessity of going through all the
  dismal and dangerous Offices, to which the Sheriffs
  of Marseilles are forced to sacrifice themselves? Seeing
  that very quickly, to oblige those Slaves to
  make more Dispatch, and carry off putrified Bodies
  which they cannot endure to touch, nor even so
  much as to approach, without being excited and
  urged on, the Sheriffs are forced to put themselves
  at their Head, and go the foremost where the Infection
  rages most, to make them carry them off:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> M. Moustier for near Two Months together was forced
  to rise constantly at Day-break, to see them put
  the Horses to the Carts, and prevent their breaking
  them; to follow them to the Pits, lest they should
  leave the Bodies on the Sides of the Pits without
  burying them; and at Night to see the Horses unharnessed;
  put into the Stables, and the Harness hung
  where they may be found next Morning, and thereby
  prevent the Inconveniences which might interrupt the
  Continuance of a Work, the Delay of which is dangerous.
  Even the Roman Consuls, so full of the Love
  of their Country, did certainly never carry their Zeal
  to so high a Pitch.</p>
<p>The 19th, Persons are chosen in all the Parishes to
  make Broth for the sick Poor, and to distribute it
  among them; and a particular Hospital is established,
  which the most moving Accidents such a Calamity can
  produce, render absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Many Women who suckled Children, dye of the
  Contagion; and the Infants are found crying in their
  Cradles, when the Bodies of the Mothers or Nurses
  are taken away; no Body will receive these Children,
  much less suckle, or feed them: There is no Pity stirring
  in the Time of a Plague, the Fear of catching the
  Contagion stifles all Sentiments of Charity, and even
  those of Humanity: To save as many as possible of these
  little Innocents, and of so many other unhappy Children
  of tender Age, whom the Pestilence has made
  Orphans, the Sheriffs take the Hospital of St. James of Galicia, and the Convent of the Fathers of Loretto,
  which were become empty by the Death or
  Flight of all those Monks; and there Care is taken
  to feed them, with Spoon-Meat, or by holding them
  to Goats to suck. The Number of them is so great,
  that tho' 30 or 40 die in a Day, there are always 12 or
  1300, by the Addition of those who are brought in
  successively every Day.</p>
<p>The 20th, Part of the Slaves, which had been received
  into the Town but Two Days before, are struck
  with the Plague, and disabled from Working; more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> are asked of the Officers of the Gallies, who grant
  Thirty Three.</p>
<p>This Day all the Millers and Bakers ceasing to work,
  because almost all their Servants have left them and
  fled, an Ordinance is issued at my Instance, requiring
  the Deserters to return, and to forbid those who remain
  to leave their Masters, on Pain of Death. Not one
  Mason is left in the Town, and divers Works are
  wanting to be done in the Church-Yards, and the
  Hospitals. A like Ordinance is published, to compel
  them to return; and another forbidding the carrying
  out of the Town, Meal or Brown Bread, designed for
  subsisting the Poor, on the Penalty of a Fine and Confiscation.</p>
<p>The 21st, the Pestilence begins to rage with so much
  Fury, and the Number of the dead is multiplied so suddenly,
  that it appears impossible to carry them off in
  Carts to the Pits without the Town; because the Carts
  cannot well go to the upper Quarter of St. John, nor
  to several others of the old Town, the Streets of which
  are narrow and steep, and yet the greatest Number of
  dead Bodies lies in those Streets, which are inhabited
  by Multitudes of the meanest People; and besides,
  it is so far from thence to the Pits without the Walls,
  that there is no doing so much Work without falling
  into the Inconvenience of leaving many Bodies behind,
  which would poison the Air, and breed a general
  Infection.</p>
<p>Upon this and other perplexing Difficulties, which
  require the Advice of a Number of judicious Persons,
  the Marquess de Pilles, and the Sheriffs desire the General
  Officers of the Gallies, to assemble with them at the
  Town-House, and give them their Advice: It is there
  resolved,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>1. That for the Reasons above specified, and for avoiding
    the Inconveniencies which 'tis apprehended
    might be fatal, the Dead shall be buried in the Pits
    without the Walls, and also in the Vaults of the
    Churches of the Jacobines, the Observantines, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> Grand Carmelites, and of Loretto; that these Churches
    being situate in the upper Town, where is the greatest
    Number of dead Bodies, and where the Carts cannot
    easily pass; a kind of Biers shall be made, on which
    the Slaves, shall carry off those Bodies from thence:
    that at each Church, Heaps of Lime shall be laid, and
    Barrels of Water placed, to be thrown into the Vaults,
    and when they are filled, they shall be closed up with a
    Cement, so that no Infection may exhale.</p>
  <p>2. That a trusty Person with some Guards on Horseback,
    shall march at the Head of the Carts, and with
    each Brigade of Slaves, to make them work diligently,
    and prevent their losing Time in stealing.</p>
  <p>3. Lest the Pits and the several Church-yards in which
    the Dead are buried, should exhale the Infection, for
    want of being filled up and covered with the necessary
    Quantity of Earth and Lime; a general and exact
    View shall be taken, and sufficient Heaps of both shall
    be laid there.</p>
  <p>4. Several Parishes and Quarters being destitute of
    Commissaries, who have fled, and Persons to supply
    their room not being to be found, each Convent shall
    be obliged to furnish Monks to act as Commissaries in
    those Quarters where they are wanted.</p>
  <p>5. For preventing Communication, the Bishop shall
    be desired to cause all Divine Service in the Churches
    to cease.</p>
  <p>6. To keep the Populace in Awe and obedient to
    Orders, Gibbets shall be set up in all the publick
    Places.</p>
</div>
<p>The 21st, the Sheriffs acquainting the Council of
  Marine with the Increase of the Contagion, desire
  them to allow all ordinary Business to remain suspended
  for the future, that they may apply themselves entirely
  to what regards the publick Health only.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>When the Plague rages thus in a City, every one
  looking on himself as at the Point of Death, is no
  longer in a Disposition to apply himself to any thing,
  but what tends immediately to his own Preservation.</p>
<p>In the mean while every thing is grown scarce in the
  Town, even such things of which there is ordinarily
  the greatest Plenty: Linnen cannot be had for covering
  the Mattresses in the Hospitals, tho' Search is made for
  it by breaking open all the Warehouses and Shops.
  The Report of the Plague keeps out whatever used to
  be brought daily into the Port from all Parts of the
  World: The Sheriffs are obliged therefore to write to
  the first President, to desire him to send what Linnen
  can be had at Aix, and also Shooes for the Slaves, there
  being no Shooemaker at Marseilles to make them.</p>
<p>Were it not for his Attention to the Wants of
  the Sheriffs, and his Care to supply them, they would
  be in a thousand Perplexities: Twice or thrice a Day
  they take the Liberty to write to him, and always with
  equal Goodness he exerts himself to answer their Demands,
  condescending to give Directions in Matters beneath
  the Functions of his Ministry; and as if it were
  not enough to employ his own Care and Pains Night
  and Day, for saving this unfortunate City, he extends
  his Concern for it yet further, by chusing to be represented
  here by M. Rigord, his Subdelegate, who
  acts with so great Application and Zeal, that tho' the
  Plague has ravaged his House, tho' he has seen his Lady
  perish by his Side, and all his Family, Clerks, and
  Servants swept away, these Horrors have not shaken
  him, nor drawn him aside one Moment from his continual
  Labours for the Relief of the Town.</p>
<p>This Day, upon Information that several Bakers to
  conceal their Desertion, have committed their Shops
  and Ovens to the Management of their Servants, who
  appear there only for Show, but do nothing; an Ordinance
  is published at my Instance, enjoyning them to
  return and look to their own Business, forbidding them
  to absent themselves again on Pain of Death. Another
  Ordinance is issued, to oblige likewise the Intendants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> Health, those of the Office of Plenty, the Counsellors
  of the City, and all other municipal Officers, to return
  within 24 Hours, on the Penalty of a Fine of 1000
  Livres, and of being declared incapable of all municipal
  Offices.</p>
<p>The same Day the Bishop, to whom the Marquess de
  Pilles had notified the Resolutions taken in the Assembly
  the Day before, sets forth to him in a Letter several
  Reasons against burying the infected Dead in the
  Vaults of the Churches of the Convents chosen for
  that Use.</p>
<p>Whereupon the Marquess de Pilles, having invited
  the General Officers of the Gallies to meet again at the
  Town-House, with the Sheriffs, and some other good
  Citizens: After the Reasons urged in the said Letter
  had been well considered, and weighed against that
  which had determined them to pass the Resolution
  for burying in the Churches, which is, the absolute
  and indispensible Necessity of doing it; they unanimously
  conclude that the said Resolution shall stand,
  but that the Execution of it shall be forborn 24 Hours,
  to see whether in that Interval the Mortality shall happen
  to decrease, so that it may be dispensed with; but
  that in the mean time, without any Delay, the Vaults
  in the Churches shall be got ready, and all the Lime
  and Water necessary carried thither.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 23d, when this Work was setting about, the
  Monks of those Churches shut up the Doors, and refused
  to open them. M. Moustier repairs thither, causes
  them to be forced open, and all the Lime and Barrels
  of Water requisite to be brought thither by Carts. As
  for Biers, for want of Joyners, he puts the first Persons
  that come in his way upon making them as well as
  they can: The Publick Services in Cases of Extremity
  are dispatched, where Magistrates know how to direct
  and command, and will see themselves obeyed.</p>
<p>This Day, the Mortality is so far from decreasing,
  that near 1000 Persons dye; and it being evident there
  is no room to hesitate about burying in the Churches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> seeing otherwise the dead Bodies would become gradually
  too numerous to be carried off, all Dispositions are
  made for setting about it to-Morrow Morning every
  where at once, and the Officers of the Gallies are
  pleased to furnish for this Purpose 20 Slaves more.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 24th, that all Dispatch might be made, and a
  Work which disheartens Men by the visible Danger
  and Terrors of Death not slackened, M. Moustier appears
  in Person, animating and urging on the Slaves,
  as well by his Intrepidity and Courage, as by his Actions;
  and when the Vaults are filled, and the Lime and
  Water thrown in, he takes care to have them well
  closed up, and Cement laid over every Hole and
  Crevice.</p>
<p>The Marquess de Pilles, and the other Sheriffs are as
  active in the mean time to put in Execution all the
  other Things resolved on.</p>
<p>They appoint the most trusty Persons they can find,
  to go on Horseback with Guards at the Head of the
  Carts, and of each Brigade of Slaves; but those Persons
  do not hold out long in so perilous an Employment, and
  they are soon obliged to act themselves in that Station.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>They have no Occasion to go to desire the Bishop
  to cause Divine Service to cease in the Churches,
  they are generally shut up already: There are hardly
  any Masses now said any where, no Administration of
  the Sacraments, not so much as the tolling of Bells, all
  the Ecclesiasticks are fled, and even some of the Parish-Priests.</p>
<p>As for Monks, they cannot possibly find any to act
  as Commissaries in the Quarters where they are wanted;
  some have deserted, others are dead, and not a
  sufficient Number of them are left, to confess the
  Sick; Father Milay, a Jesuit, is the only Man of them
  all, who to satisfy that Holy Zeal, and fervent Charity,
  by which he has been always actuated, comes voluntarily
  and offers to be Commissary in the Street of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> Lescale, and thereabouts; an Employment which none
  else durst take, because it is the Part of the Town
  where the Plague makes the greatest Havock, and
  which is barricaded with Corps de Garde at the Avenues,
  that no Person may enter, or stir out of it; the
  Sheriffs make him Commissary there, where from the
  Beginning of the Contagion he has confessed the infected.
  He performs Acts of Piety surpassing any
  thing called Heroick; but the Plague does not spare
  him long, it snatches from the Faithful this new
  Apostle.</p>
<p>They go to take a View of the Pits and Churchyards;
  a horrid Spectacle, dangerous to approach,
  the vast Number of infected Bodies but lately thrown
  into them, lying all uncovered, heaped by Thousands
  on one another.</p>
<p>Formerly Governors and Consuls during all the Time
  of Contagion, used to keep shut up in the Town-House
  with very great Precaution; all who have formed
  Rules for Towns visited with the Plague, have prescribed
  that Conduct, judging that the Magistrates
  ought to be more careful than all others, to preserve
  their Life and Health.</p>
<p>Here, the Marquess de Pilles, and the Sheriffs, think
  only of preserving the Life and Health of others, exposing
  their own without any Concern; and are Night
  and Day in the open Street, wherever they see Danger
  deter others.</p>
<p>The Marquess de Pilles has so little Regard for himself,
  that at the first he lets the principal Pest-House
  (which is that des Convalescens) be settled within 4
  Paces of his own House. M. Estelle goes all Night
  long, so void of fear, to see the dead Bodies carried off
  the Street Lescale, that slipping on the Pavement he
  was within a Finger's Breadth of falling full upon a
  dead Body that lay on the Ground before him: M. Moustier sets so light by Dangers that make others
  tremble, that a Plaister reeking with the Corruption
  of the Bubo of an infected Person thrown out of the
  Window, lighting on his Cheek, and sticking there, he
  takes it off perfectly unconcerned, and only wiping his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> Cheek clean with his Spunge dipped in Vinegar, proceeds
  on the Business he is about. The others behaved
  much in the same manner.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 25th, the Plague has spread into the four Corners
  of the City, and exercises its Rage on all Sides:
  From this time to the End of September it rages with
  the same Violence, it strikes like Lightning every where,
  sweeps all before it, and carries off above a Thousand
  Souls a Day.</p>
<p>Its Violence now attacks by Crowds only, and its
  Fury gives a Thousand Deaths at once. In Consequence,
  the Pest-Houses established are insufficient to receive all
  the poor Sick; it is resolved to make a new one, large
  enough to take in any Number; and there not being
  without the Town, nor in it, a Building capacious enough
  for that Purpose, it is resolved to erect one (as the Physicians
  of Montpellier had advised) in the Allies of that
  spacious Piece of Ground used for playing at Mall, which
  is without the Gate des faineants, contiguous to the
  Convent of the Reformed Augustines, with Timber-Work
  to be covered with Sail-Cloath made of Cotton:
  This is a new Difficulty for the Sheriffs, to have such
  an Hospital to build, without being able to reckon upon
  the Assistance of any Person, and even without any
  Workmen, for they are generally fled.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 26th, the Chamber of Vacations being informed
  that almost all the Bakers of Marseilles have
  deserted, and being desirous to prevent the Extremity
  to which the City will be reduced, if at such a Conjuncture
  sufficient Quantities of Bread should not be
  made; they publish an Arr�t, commanding all Bakers and their Foremen who have withdrawn, to return on
  Pain of Death; and enjoining the Consuls of the
  Places where they may have taken Refuge, to deliver
  them up, on the Penalty of a Fine and other Punishment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>All the Shops of Retailers being shut up, so that
  People have no whither to go to buy common Necessaries,
  an Ordinance is published at my Instance,
  to oblige the Retailers to open their Shops within
  Twenty Four Hours, otherwise they shall be broken open.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 27th, the Chamber of Vacations commiserating
  the Condition of Marseilles, and the Sufferings
  of its Inhabitants, publish an Arr�t, enjoining all
  Artificers, Tradesmen and Wholesale Dealers, to open
  their Shops and Warehouses within Twentyfour Hours,
  on Pain of Death.</p>
<p>This Day the Marquess de Pilles, who from the Beginning
  of the Contagion has been continually at the
  Town-House, or wherever his Zeal called him, that is
  to say, where was most Danger and Difficulty, without
  any Care of his own Safety, sinks at length under the
  Weight of his Fatigues, and falling sick is unable to
  stir out of his House; The Fear of losing a Governor,
  whose Merit and Person are held in Veneration at Marseilles,
  gives a general Alarm.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 28th, the Plague redoubles its Ravages, and the
  whole City is become a vast Church-yard, presenting to
  the View the sad Spectacle of dead Bodies cast in Heaps
  one upon another.</p>
<p>In this deplorable State, a thousand Things are to be
  done, a Thousand Wants to be supplied, and yet there
  is no Person to have Recourse to for Relief; the People
  of the Territory are deaf to all Demands, they cannot
  by any Order issued be wrought upon, to bring in so
  much as Straw for the Mattresses in the Hospitals, and
  Hay for the Horses belonging to the Carts: The Sheriffs
  seeing nothing is to be done but by Force, desire
  the first President to procure them the Assistance of
  some Hundred Men of regular Troops.</p>
<p>They apply next to the Officers of the Gallies, remonstrating
  to them, that the common Safety is at
  Stake; that almost all the Slaves they have already
  granted them are dead, and that the Number of dead
  Bodies the City is fill'd with is so exceeding great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> that they cannot be carried off, unless they will be
  pleas'd to let them have a sufficient Number to make
  a strong Effort.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>M. de Ranc�, Lieutenant-General, commanding the
  Gallies, M. de Vaucresson, Intendant, and all the General
  Officers, are moved with the miserable Condition
  they see Marseilles in; they make too noble and
  eminent a Part or it, not to be thoroughly concern'd
  to see it wholly perish; they have shewn, on all Occasions,
  their good Intentions; and in this, there is not
  one of them, who, to help to save the City, would
  not hazard his own Life: But not having received Order
  to the present Purpose from the Council of Marine,
  they make a Difficulty to grant so great a Number of
  Slaves as is requisite, and will part with but 80; and
  this with a Protestation, that they shall be the last.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This Protestation obliges the Sheriffs to exert themselves
  more than ever, to make these Slaves do all the
  Service that is possible: M. Moustier, not satisfying himself
  with the toilsome Care of providing them Lodging
  and Subsistance, and of going every Morning to
  see them harness the Horses, and get to work with
  the Carts, puts himself at the Head of the largest
  Brigade, leads them to the Places that are least accessible,
  where lye the greatest Heaps of putrified Bodies,
  and encourages them to carry them off, either whole,
  or by Pieces.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the mean while a Letter is written to the Council
  of Marine, most humbly to intreat his Royal Highness
  to be pleased to give Orders for supplying the Town:
  Which wanting all Things, there being no Meat to
  make Broth with for the poor Sick, and Famine destroying
  those whom the Plague might spare, his Royal
  Highness is earnestly besought to order the neighbouring
  Provinces to send in the necessary Provisions for subsisting
  the People.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>The 29th, several Ordinances are issued, at my Instance.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>1. All the Rakers, and others employed under the
    Scavengers to clean the Streets, having deserted since
    the Beginning of the Contagion, for fear of being made
    use of as Buriers of the Dead: the whole Town since
    the Second of this Month, is full of Dunghils and Poisonous
    Filth, which stagnates on the Pavement: They
    are by an Ordinance commanded to return on Pain of
    Death.</p>
  <p>2. From out of the Houses, the Quilts, Straw-Beds,
    Bed-Cloaths, Apparel, and Rags used about the Infected,
    are thrown into the Streets; so that there is
    no passing them. An Ordinance forbids it, and enjoins
    that all such Things be drawn to the publick
    Squares, and immediately burnt, on Pain of Imprisonment.</p>
  <p>3. For want of Porters, the very Corn, which the
    Boats bring up from the Barrier of Lestaque, cannot
    be carried into the Store-Houses; those Porters are
    all engaged in the Service of private Persons in the
    Territory: An Ordinance commands them to come and
    work as usual in the City, on Pain of Death; and
    private Persons are forbidden to detain them, on the
    Penalty of a Fine of 3000 Livres, and of Imprisonment.</p>
  <p>4. For want of those who used to ply with Asses,
    the Bakers cannot get the Wood carried with
    which the Town furnishes them; and all private
    Persons are under the like Inconvenience: An Ordinance
    charges those Ass-Keepers to return with their
    Beasts, on Pain of Death.</p>
</div>
<p>The Chamber of Vacations being informed, that
  the Intendants of Health, and the Commissaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> appointed in the Parishes and Quarters, who have
  deserted, do not obey the Ordinance of the Sheriffs
  and return; that Chamber issues an Arr�t
  this Day, commanding them all to return forthwith
  to their Duties, on Pain of Death.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>All these Arr�ts and Ordinances are duly proclaimed
  by Sound of Trumpet, and affixed at all
  the Corners of the Streets, and in all the Quarters
  of the Territories, but to no manner of Purpose;
  the Dread of the Plague is so strong and
  terrible, that nothing can overcome it. It is indeed
  impossible for the Heart of Man to bear up
  against all the frightful Spectacles that present themselves
  every where to the Eye in this unhappy City;
  the dire Effects of a raging Pestilence, which
  seems to threaten not to be asswaged by the Death
  only and general Extinction of all the Inhabitants,
  but by rendring the Place it self a vast Sink of
  Corruption and Poison, for ever uninhabitable by
  human Race.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Which Way soever one turns, the Streets appear
  strowed on both Sides with dead Bodies
  close by each other, most of which being putrified,
  are unsupportably hideous to behold.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>As the Number of Slaves employed to take them
  out of the Houses, is very insufficient to be able
  to carry all off daily, some frequently remain there
  whole Weeks; and there would remain longer, if
  the Stench they emit, which poisons the Neighbours,
  did not compel them for their own Preservation,
  to overcome all Aversion to such horrid Work,
  and go into the Apartments where they lye, to
  drag them down into the Streets: They pull them
  out with Hooks, and hawl them by Ropes fastened
  to the Staves of those Hooks into the Streets: This
  they do in the Night, that they may draw them
  to some Distance from their own Houses; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> leave them extended before another's Door, who at
  opening it the next Morning is frighted at the
  Sight of such an Object, which generally infects
  him, and gives him Death.</p>
<p>The Ring, and all publick Walks, Squares, and
  Market-Places, the Key of the Port, are spread
  with dead Bodies, some lying in Heaps: The
  Square before the Building called the Loge, and
  the Pallisades of the Port, are filled with the continual
  Number of dead Bodies that are brought ashore
  from the Ships and Vessels, which are crowded
  with Families, whom Fear induced to take Refuge
  there, in a false Persuasion, that the Plague
  would not reach them upon the Water.</p>
<p>Under every Tree in the Ring and the Walks,
  under every Pent-House of the Shops in the Streets
  and on the Port, one sees among the Dead a prodigious
  Number of poor Sick, and even whole Families,
  lying on a little Straw, or on ragged Mattresses;
  some are in a languishing Condition, to be
  relieved only by Death; others are light-headed
  by the Force of the Venom which rages in them:
  They implore the Assistance of those who pass by;
  some in pitiful Complaints, some in Groans and
  Out-cries which Pain or Frenzy draw from them.
  An intolerable Stink exhales from among them:
  They not only endure the Effects of the Distemper,
  but suffer equally by the publick Want of Food
  and common Necessaries: They dye under the Rags
  that cover them, and every Moment adds to the
  Number of the Dead that lye about them. It
  rends the Heart, to behold on the Pavement so
  many wretched Mothers, who have lying by their Sides
  the dead Bodies of their Children, whom they have
  seen expire, without being able to give them any Relief;
  and so many poor Infants still hanging at the
  Breasts of their Mothers, who died holding them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> their Arms, sucking in the rest of that Venom which
  will soon put them into the same Condition.</p>
<p>If any Space be yet left in the Streets, it is filled
  with infected Houshold-Goods and Cloaths, which are
  thrown out of the Windows every where; so that
  one cannot find a void Place to set one's Foot
  in.</p>
<p>All the Dogs and Cats that are killed, lye putrifying
  every where among the dead Bodies, the Sick,
  and the infected Cloaths; all the Port is filled with
  those thrown into them; and while they float, they add
  their Stench to the general Infection, which has spread
  all over the Town, and preys upon the Vitals, the
  Senses, and the Mind.</p>
<p>Those one meets in the Street, are generally livid
  and drooping, as if their Souls had begun to part from
  their Bodies; or whom the Violence of the Distemper
  has made delirious, who, wandring about they know
  not whither, as long as they can keep on their Legs,
  soon drop, through Weakness; and, unable to get up
  again, expire on the Spot; some writhed into
  strange Postures, denoting the torturing Venom which
  struck them to the Heart; others are agitated by such
  Disorders of Mind, that they cut their own Throats,
  or leap into the Sea, or throw themselves out of the
  Windows, to put an End to their Misery, and prevent
  the Death which was not far off. Nothing is to be
  heard or seen on all Sides but Distress, Lamentation,
  Tears, Sighs, Groans, Affright, Despair.</p>
<p>To conceive so many Horrors, one must figure to
  one's self, in one View, all the Miseries and Calamities
  that Human Nature is subject to; and one cannot
  venture to draw near such a Scene, without being
  struck dead, or seiz'd with unutterable Horrors of
  Mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>The 30th, those Heaps of dead Bodies which are in
  every Quarter of the City, are increas'd by new ones;
  every Night adds a thousand Dead; and now none of
  the Slaves are left to work, they are all dead, or sick
  of the Distemper; nor can more be demanded, after
  the Protestation made by the Officers of the
  Gallies.</p>
<p>What can be done in Circumstances so full of Desolation?
  The Sheriffs have Recourse, as usual, to the
  First President, and intreat him to dispatch a Courier
  for them to the Court, to sollicit his Royal Highness
  to send Orders for their being supplied with as many
  Galley-Slaves as they shall have occasion for: They
  desire him also to write to M. de Ranc� and de Vaucresson,
  to persuade them to grant, in the mean while,
  at least a Hundred.</p>
<p>The 31st, it is impossible for the Hospitals to receive
  the Number of Sick who crowd thither: As
  soon as one Person in a House is seized with the Distemper,
  that Person becomes an Object of Horror and
  Affright to the nearest Relations; Nature instantly
  forgets all ordinary Duties; and the Bands of Flesh
  and Blood being less strong than the Fear of certain
  Death, shamefully dissolve in an Instant.</p>
<p>As the Distemper which has seized that Person,
  threatens to attack them; as the Contagion communicates
  it self with extreme Quickness; as the Danger
  is almost equal to him that suffers, and to those who
  approach him; and as those who tend and help him
  have no other Prospect than that of following him in
  a few Days; they take at first the barbarous Resolution,
  either to drive him out of the House, or to fly
  and desert it themselves, and to leave him alone
  without Assistance or Relief, abandoned to Hunger,
  Thirst, and all that can render Death the more
  tormenting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus Wives treat their Husbands, and Husbands
  their Wives, Children their Parents, and Parents
  their Children: Vain Precaution, inspired by Love of
  Life, and Horror of Death! By that time they take
  their Resolution, they have already catch'd the subtle
  Effluvia of the fatal Poison they would secure themselves
  from; they are soon sensible of its Malignity,
  a speedy Death is the Punishment of their Cruelty and
  Baseness: Others have the same Hardness of Heart towards
  them; they are forced into the open Street in
  their Turn, or are left alone in their Houses to perish
  without Help.</p>
<p>Hence proceeds that infinite Number of Sick, of
  each Sex, and of every Age, State, and Condition,
  who are found lying in the Streets and publick Places.
  If all are not cruelly driven out of their own Houses by
  their Relations or Friends, they prevent that Cruelty;
  and lest they should run the Hazard of being left
  alone at home, by the Flight of those Relations or
  Friends, when they are become quite helpless, they repair
  to the Hospitals; where not getting Entrance, nay,
  not being able to get near the Gates, by reason of
  the Multitudes of Sick, which have got thither before;
  and who finding them already full, lye down on the
  Pavement, and stop up all the Avenues; they are
  obliged to seek room for themselves farther off, among
  the putrified dead Bodies; the Sight and Stench of
  which serve to hasten their Death, the only End of this
  Distemper. These Extremities put the Sheriffs upon
  double Diligence, to get the New Hospital in the Alleys
  of the Mall finished: In the mean time, they
  cause large Tents to be pitched upon that Esplanade without the Town, which is between the Gate des
  Faineants, and the Monastery of the Capuchins, where
  they order as many Mattresses to be put, as the Tents
  will hold. No sooner are those Tents up, and the
  Mattresses placed, but they are filled with so many
  poor Infected, that several throw themselves upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> Mattress: A greater Number is requisite to supply them
  all; and the Misfortune is, that there is neither Straw
  nor Linnen to be had to make them with.</p>
<p>The 1st of September, the first President having
  been pleased to write to M. de Ranc�, and de Vaucresson,
  desiring them to let the Sheriffs have a hundred
  Galley-Slaves more; they are presently sent to
  them, and a more vigorous Use of them was never
  made: For M. Moustier, incited by the Extremity to
  which things are reduced, immediately puts himself at
  the Head of these Slaves, with 11 Carts, and while
  they are able, makes them carry off above 1200 dead
  Bodies a Day.</p>
<p>The 2d, for making this Labour the more easy, as
  the Bodies in the Houses occasion the most Loss of
  Time to the Slaves to fetch them away; and besides,
  being putrified by being left there long, they cannot
  draw them out with Hooks, but by Pieces; as also for
  preventing Robberies by the Slaves, who finding no
  Person in the Houses, steal all they can lay their Hands
  on; an Ordinance is published at my Instance, importting,
  that as soon as any one dies in a House, those
  belonging to that House shall be obliged to convey the
  Body down into the Street, using all proper and necessary
  Precautions.</p>
<p>The same Day an Arr�t is issued by the Chamber of
  Vacations, injoyning all the Rectors of the H�tel Dieu, de la Charit�, of Foundlings, of the Houses of the
  Penitent, and of Refuge, the Captains of the City,
  the Physicians appointed for the Hospitals, and all Sorts
  of Intendants and municipal Officers, to return to their
  Duty at Marseilles; otherwise declaring them incapable
  of Publick Offices, and fining them 1000
  Livres.</p>
<p>The 3d, the Sheriffs repair to the Town-House almost
  by themselves, with M. Capus, Keeper of the Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>cords,
  his eldest Son, so distinguish'd by his Merit and
  his Virtues, who, from the Beginning of the Contagion,
  has assisted him to go through the Multiplicity of
  Business in his Offices; M. Bouis, Cashier; and my
  self; having no longer any Guards, Domestick Servants,
  or other Person under Command. The Ravages
  the Plague has already made in this great City,
  may be judged by the Number belonging to the Town-House
  only, that have been carried off, which, is above
  500 Persons, viz. 30 Guards wearing the Shoulder-Belt,
  all the Guards de la Police, all the Captains of
  the City one excepted, all the Lieutenants except
  two, almost all the Captains Lieutenants, and Guards
  of the Five Brigades du Privilege du Vin, all the Sergeants
  of the Nightly Watch or Patroll, 350 Men of
  the Companies of the Guard, and all the City-Yeomen
  appointed to attend the Magistrates, who are now become
  destitute of all Servants.</p>
<p>Men are become only Shadows; those who are seen
  well one Day, are in the Carts the next; and, what is
  unaccountable, those who have shut themselves up most
  securely in their own Houses, and are the most careful
  to take in nothing without the most exact Precautions,
  are attacked there by the Plague, which creeps in no
  Body knows how.</p>
<p>The 4th, nothing is more deplorable, than to see
  the vast Number of Sick and Dying which are spread
  over the whole City, deprived of all spiritual as well
  as temporal Comforts, and reduced to the lamentable
  Condition of dying almost all of them without Confession.</p>
<p>There wanted not, indeed, Servants of the Lord, as
  well of the Secular as Regular Clergy, who devoted
  their Lives to the saving of Souls, and assisting
  and confessing the infected; there wanted not even
  holy Heroes, (for by that Name we ought to call all
  the Capuchins and Jesuits of the Two Houses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> St. Jeaume; and of the holy Cross, and likewise all the
  Observantins, and the Recollets, and some others)
  who, with more than heroick Courage, and indefatigable
  Charity and Zeal, ran about every where, and
  rushed precipitately into the most deserted and most
  infected Houses, into the Streets and Places that were
  thickest strow'd with putrify'd Bodies, and into the
  Hospitals that reeked most with the Contagion, to
  confess the infected, assist them in the Article of
  Death, and receive their last contagious and envenom'd
  Breath, as if it were but Dew.</p>
<p>But these sacred Labourers, who may well be
  look'd upon as true Martyrs, (seeing those of Alexandria, under the Prelacy of St. Denis, who
  had the Charity to assist the infected, were honour'd
  with the Glory of Martyrdom) are almost all
  taken away by Death, in the Time of so great a
  Mortality, when their Help is most wanted: Forty
  two Capuchins have already perished, Twenty one
  Jesuits, Thirty two Observantins, Twenty nine Recollets,
  Ten Barefooted Carmelites, Twenty two
  Reformed Augustines, all the Grand Carmelites,
  the Grand Trinitarians, the Reformed Trinitarians,
  the Monks of Loretto, of Mercy, the Dominicans and Grand Augustins who had kept in their Convent:
  besides several Secular Priests, and the greatest
  Part of the Vicars of Chapters and Parishes.</p>
<p>In so great an Extremity, the Bishop recalls
  those, who, by their peculiar Character, and by the
  Nature of their Benefice, are under the indispensible
  Obligation of confessing and administring the
  spiritual Remedies to the Dying; but who being
  struck with shameful Terror, have basely sought their
  own Safety by Flight, without troubling themselves
  about the Salvation of others.</p>
<p>Had their Concern to discharge their proper Duty
  been too cold to light up in their Hearts that Fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> of Charity with which they ought to glow, the
  Example of their holy Prelate should have excited
  them: In vain, from the Beginning of the Contagion
  was he pressed to leave the City, to endeavour
  to preserve himself, for the rest of his Diocese;
  he rejects all such Counsels, and hearkens only
  to those which the Love the Sovereign Pastor has
  inspired him with for his Flock, suggest to him;
  he tarries with unshaken Fortitude, determined to
  lay down his Life for the Good of his Sheep, if God
  is pleas'd to require it.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>He is not satisfied with prostrating himself at the
  Feet of Altars, and lifting up his Hands to Heaven to
  beseech God to mitigate his Wrath; his Charity is
  active; he is every Day in the open Streets, through all
  Quarters of the Town; he goes up to the highest and
  worst Apartments of the Houses to visit the Sick;
  crosses the Streets among the dead Bodies; appears in
  the publick Places, at the Port, at the Ring; the
  poorest, the most destitute of Friends, those afflicted
  the most grievously and hideously, are the Persons to
  whom he goes with most Earnestness; and without
  dreading those mortal Blasts which carry Poison to the
  Heart, he approaches them, confesses them, exhorts
  them to Patience, disposes them to die, pours celestial
  Consolations into their Souls, representing to them
  the Felicity of Suffering and of Poverty; and drops
  every where abundant Fruits of his generous Charity,
  distributing Money where-ever he goes, and especially
  in secret to indigent Families, whom holy Curiosity
  prompts him to seek out and to relieve; he has
  already given away Twenty five thousand Crowns,
  and takes up what Money he can upon Pledges, to
  enable him to distribute more. But I should not
  blaze abroad what his Humility is careful to conceal,
  it ought to be left under the Veil which that Virtue
  throws over it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Death has spared this new Charles Borromeo, but
  has continually surrounded him, and almost mowed
  under his Feet: The Plague gets into his Palace,
  the greatest Part of his Officers and Domesticks
  are struck with it; he is obliged to retreat into
  the House of the first President at Marseilles; the
  Plague pursues him thither, and not only attacks
  the rest of his Domesticks, but Two Persons who
  are very dear to him for their distinguished Merit,
  and are his Assistants in his holy Labours,
  Father de la Fare a Jesuit, and M. Bourgeret Canon of la Major; the first escapes, but he has
  the Grief to see the other expire: All this however
  does not terrify him, nor with-hold him one
  Moment from any of the Duties of his fervent
  Charity; he goes every where still to visit the Infected.</p>
<p>But the Plague destroys too fast for the surviving
  Remnant of Confessors to perform all the
  Service necessarily required: A greater Number of
  Workmen should be had; wherefore the Canons
  of the Collegiate Church of St. Martin, and some
  of that of Acoules, who have Benefices with
  Cure of Souls, and who have fled, are those the
  Bishop recals, to come and confess, each within the
  Bounds of his parish.</p>
<p>The Sheriffs, who observe all those Parish-Priests
  are deaf to the Voice of their Bishop, and unconcerned
  for the Loss of the Souls of their Parishioners,
  present a Petition to the Bishop, to order
  them by an Injunction to return forthwith to their
  Duty; in default of which their Benefices to be
  declared vacant, and other Persons qualified to fill
  them, to be nominated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>The 5th, the Regulators of the Fishermen being
  capable of some Service, and Three of them
  having fled; an Ordinance is published at my Instance,
  to oblige them to return, on the Penalty of
  a Fine of Three Thousand Livres, and of losing their
  Offices.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This Day the Sheriffs being astonish'd at the Increase
  of the Mortality, and the deplorable State the City is
  in, and longing for an Answer to the Dispatches they
  have sent to Court for necessary Supplies, write to
  the Marshal de Villars, most earnestly beseeching him
  to second their Instances: That Illustrious Governor,
  who among all the Towns of his Government of Provence, has constantly honoured Marseilles with his
  particular Affection, is so concerned to hear of the
  extreme Desolation it is in, that he returns Answer,
  He is resolved to come himself to its Relief, if his
  Royal Highness will give him Leave.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The 6th, the Sheriffs find themselves reduced to
  the most terrible of all Extremities; the last Slaves
  which the Officers of the Gallies had granted, at
  the Request of the first President, being all either
  dead, or fallen ill of the Distemper; and notwithstanding
  all the Efforts M. Moustier had made the
  preceeding Days, to get all the dead Bodies possible
  carried off, above Two Thousand still remaining
  in the Streets, besides what are in the Houses; they
  see plainly, that if the Officers of the Gallies will
  not give them more Slaves, at the rate the Mortality
  goes on, there must be in less than Eight
  Days above Fifteen Thousand Bodies in the Streets
  all putrified; from which will ensue a Necessity of
  quitting the Town, and abandoning it perhaps for
  ever, to the Putrefaction, Poison, and Infection which
  will settle in it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>Hereupon they assemble, with the few Citizens
  still left, among whom are two Intendants of Health
  who have not stirred a Foot, M. Rose the Elder,
  and M. Rollaud. Divers Expedients are debated;
  some propose, that for disposing of the present
  dead Bodies, and those to be expected daily, a
  large Pit should be opened in every Street to
  throw them into: But two things are objected;
  one is, that such Pits cannot be dug in the Streets,
  without cutting off, at the same time, all the Conduit-Pipes
  which are laid through them; the other
  is, that it would require above Ten Thousand Men
  to dig speedily so many Pits in so vast a City,
  while there is none to be found in a Condition to
  work; besides, no body would dig in Streets actually
  strewed with infected Bodies, for fear of catching
  the Infection by touching them. Others propose,
  to let all the Bodies lie where they are, in
  the Streets, the publick Places, and the Houses, and
  there to cover them with Lime to consume them;
  and that such a Quantity of Lime be carried in
  Carts, and laid in Heaps in every Street, as may
  serve to consume all the dead Bodies that shall be
  there. But to this likewise there are several Objections;
  Where is Lime enough to be had for
  consuming so many Bodies? Where are Men to help
  to cart it? And who could stay in the City amidst
  the horrible Infection which those Bodies
  would exhale, as they are consuming?</p>
<p>The Course the Sheriffs think best to take, is,
  without passing any Resolution, to desire the Citizens
  assembled with them, to accompany them, in
  their Hoods, and in a Body, to the House of M. de Ranc� to intreat him with all Earnestness, to
  grant them the Assistance they want for the Preservation
  of the City.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>M. de Ranc� calls together M. de Vaucresson the Intendant,
  and the General Officers of the Gallies;
  they appear to be touched as much with the Zeal of
  these Magistrates, and with the burthensome and hazardous
  Conditions upon which they ask this Assistance,
  as with the great Extremity the City is in; accordingly
  they grant them all they demand on those Conditions;
  and being desirous to have the Agreement
  put into Writing, I drew up before them the following
  Act to be entred in the Register of the
  Town-House, and a Copy of it to be given to
  them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This Day, the Sheriffs, Protectors, and Defenders
  of the Privileges, Liberties, and Immunities, of this
  City of Marseilles, the King's Counsellors, Lieutenants-General de Police, being assembled in the
  Town-House, with some of the municipal Officers,
  the Counsellor Orator of the City and the King's
  Procurator de la Police, and other eminent Citizens;
  and taking into Consideration, that though the 260
  Slaves, which the Officers of the Gallies have been
  pleased to grant them at different Times, to bury
  the Dead since the City was afflicted with the Plague;
  have been extremely helpful to them hitherto, yet
  that Assistance is insufficient, above 2000 dead Bodies
  having actually lain in the Streets several Days;
  and causing a general Infection; it was therefore
  resolved, for preserving the City, to desire greater
  Assistance: And immediately the Sheriffs going out in
  their Hoods, accompanied by all the said municipal
  Officers and eminent Citizens, went in a Body to
  the House of the Chevalier de Ranc�, Lieutenant-General,
  commanding his Majesty's Gallies, and represented
  to him, that the City has infinite Obligations
  to him for the signal Services which he has
  been pleased to do them in this Calamity; but that
  it is not possible to preserve the City, unless he does
  them the favour to grant them a Hundred Slaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
more, and 4 Officers of the Whistle (or Boatswains) (almost
  all those who have formerly been granted, being dead
  or sick;) in which Case they will make the best Use
  of them; that to engage them to work with the
  greater Diligence in carrying off the dead Bodies,
  they will expose themselves as they have already
  done; will march on Horseback in their Hoods, before
  the Carts, and go with them all over the City:
  That moreover, it being of Importance, that their
  Authority should be supported by Force, at a time
  when there remains in the City only a numerous
  Populace, who must be kept under, for preventing
  all Tumult, and for maintaining good Order
  every where; they further intreat him most
  earnestly to grant them at least Forty stout Soldiers
  of the Gallies, to obey their Orders, to attend them,
  and at the same time hinder the Slaves from getting
  away; that they shall be commanded by themselves
  only; that they will divide them into 4 Parties, of
  which each Sheriff will head One; and it being necessary
  that one of the Sheriffs, at least, should be
  continually at the Town-House, for the Dispatch of
  such Affairs as may occur, one of the said Parties
  shall be commanded by the Chevalier Rose; and in
  Case they should be hindred by any Accident, they
  will propose in their Room, Commissaries of the best
  Distinction they can find, to head and command
  them. Whereupon the Chevalier de Ranc�, being
  assembled with the Intendant and General Officers
  of the Gallies, all sensible of the miserable Condition
  of this great and important City, and willing to
  grant all that is necessary for saving it, have been
  pleased to grant to the Sheriffs, and to the Community,
  a Hundred Slaves more, and 40 Soldiers, among
  them 4 Corporals, with 4 Officers of the Whistle; and
  it being necessary to take those who are voluntarily
  disposed, and to engage them by Rewards, to this
  dangerous Service; It is resolved and agreed, that
  besides Subsistance which the Community shall furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to them all, ten Livres a Day shall be given to each Officer
  of the Whistle, and to each Soldier fifty Sols: And
  after it shall please God to deliver the City from this Visitation,
  a Gratification of a hundred Livres, to be paid
  at once, shall be made to each of them who shall then
  be living. The Corporals shall have each a hundred
  Sols a Day, and also an annual Pension for Life of a hundred
  Livres to each of them who shall survive; it being
  judged they cannot be sufficiently rewarded for so important
  and perillous a Service, This is agreed by the Assembly,
  in consideration of the present Exigence, and the
  Necessity of the Time. Concluded at Marseilles, the
  6<sup>th</sup> of September, 1720. Signed, Estelle, Audimar, Moustier, Dieud�, Sheriffs; Pichatty de Croissaint�,
  Orator, and the King's Procurator; Capus, Keeper of
  the Records.</p>
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup>, the Magistrates taking into Consideration,
  that the Plague being the Instrument of God's Wrath,
  all the Help of Men, and all the Efforts they resolve
  to make, will be vain and useless, unless they have
  Recourse to his Mercy, and seek to appease him; they
  determine to make a Vow in the Name of the City, to
  incline him to vouchsafe to deliver it from this cruel Pestilence
  (as their Predecessors did during the last Plague,)
  that the Community shall give every Year, for ever, the
  Sum of 2000 Livres to a House of Charity, to be established
  by the Title and under the Protection of Our
  Lady of Good Help, for the Reception of poor Girls,
  Orphans of this City and its Territory.</p>
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup>, they make this Vow solemnly in the Presence
  of the Bishop, in the Chapel of the Town-House,
  where he celebrates Mass.</p>
<p>The same Day having received the Slaves, and the
  Officers of the Whistle, together with the Soldiers
  (whose Corps de Garde is settled in the great Hall of
  the Loge,) and M. Moustier having got in Readiness the
  Carts, and divided the Slaves into several Brigades,
  the Sheriffs in their Hoods put themselves each at the
  Head of one of those Brigades, with a Division or
  Guard of Soldiers, and go to the Places that are thickest
  spread with dead Bodies, and where they are most
  putrefied, with an Intrepidity that astonishes the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> Soldiers, and makes the Slaves work with all their
  Strength, without fearing the Dangers which they see
  them so much contemn: They continue this Work
  daily, from Morning till Night, and the Chevalier Rose on Horseback, constantly supplies the Room of that
  Sheriff who is obliged in his Turn to sit in the Town-House
  for the ordinary Dispatch of Business: 'Tis a
  Miracle that they have not all perished, by exposing
  themselves to Dangers so great, that the forty Soldiers
  of the Gallies, who accompanied them, have all perished,
  except four, by their Sides.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup>, they send to the Council of Marine a Copy
  of the Act, specifying the Conditions on which the
  Officers of the Gallies granted those Soldiers, and the
  Slaves; another to the Marshal de Villars, and a third to
  the Grand Prior.</p>
<p>The 10<sup>th</sup>, the first President, who is always vigilant
  to supply their Wants, and who knows that besides
  Carts, they more need Carters to drive them, sends
  a Number of both from Aix, which are very helpful:
  The Officers of the Gallies furnish them with twenty
  five Slaves more, to replace those of the hundred already
  granted who are become unable to work; and
  add to them six, who are Butchers by Profession, to
  serve in the Slaughter-houses of the Town, where all
  the Butchers being dead, or having deserted, no body
  is left to kill Oxen and Sheep.</p>
<p>The 11<sup>th</sup>, there being hardly any Physicians remaining,
  and fewer Surgeons, the rest having deserted, or
  perished, their Art not availing them; the first President
  sends hither M. Pons and Boutellier, Physicians of
  the Faculty of Montpellier; and M. Montet and Rabaton,
  very skilful Master-Surgeons.</p>
<p>The 12<sup>th</sup>, the Sheriff's are informed that the Commandeur
  M. de Langeron, Commadore of a Squadron of
  Gallies, and Major-General of the King's Armies,
  has been nominated by his Majesty Governour of Marseilles and its Territory, and that he has received his
  Commission. Such agreeable and salutary News revives
  them immediately from all the Sorrow, Dejection, and
  Consternation they were in; and inspires, not only into
  them, but into all the other Citizens, and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> People in general, both Sick and Well, no less Joy,
  Pleasure and Content, than Confidence, new Spirit, and
  Courage: They think it impossible to perish under so
  worthy a Governour, and the Preservation of Marseilles is looked upon as certain under his Auspices and Conduct:
  The Affection he has always been observed to
  bear to this City, and which he has demonstrated since
  it became afflicted with the Plague; his having been
  pleased, not only to come and assist in the Assemblies
  at the Town-House, but to promote very much the
  giving Assistance to the City by the Officers of the Gallies
  (in which naval Body of Forces he is distinguished
  by his Rank, as well as by his Merit and Valour:)
  His Character so long established, his illustrious Name,
  his Presence, which by a happy Mixture of Sweetness
  and Gravity makes him at once respected, loved, and
  feared; his Wisdom and Foresight, his Courage, his
  Firmness; Virtues, which qualify and dispose him to
  chuse the best Expedients in pressing Occasions, and execute
  with Rigour what he has judiciously resolved; all
  this, I say, gives every body, and particularly the Sheriffs,
  the most promising Hopes, which in the Event
  were soon answered: They go in their Hoods, and in
  a Body, to his House, to have the Honour to make
  him a Tender of their Duties.</p>
<p>They learn at the same time, that the Marquess de
  Pilles (who has newly begun to recover his Health) has
  also received a Commission to command in the City
  and Territory; they go in the same manner to his House,
  to make him the like Compliments: And both their
  Commissions being sent to be entred in the Register
  of the Town-House, it appears that M. de Langeron, in
  the Quality of Major-General of the King's Forces, is
  to take place, and command in Chief.</p>
<p>The same Day, M. de Langeron mounts on Horseback,
  and comes to the Town-House, to inform himself
  of the State of Affairs, that he might thereupon
  make the proper Dispositions, and take the necessary
  Measures for applying speedy Remedies to pressing
  Evils: He is accompanied by the Chevalier de Soissans,
  an Officer of the Gallies, whom he has taken to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> Assistance; and who is so ardent for relieving the
  Town, that he is every Day on Horseback from Morning
  till Night, running wherever any thing is to be
  done, and to provide against, or redress, those Inconveniences
  which appear most insuperable; contemning
  Danger, and compelling others, by his Example, not
  to relax or stop; putting in Execution Things seeming
  the most impossible, with that Activity, Prudence, and
  indefatigable Zeal, that every thing is done by his Care,
  and by his Assistance.</p>
<p>The 13<sup>th</sup>, the Marquess de Pilles comes to the Town-House;
  his Presence, after the Grief and Alarm his
  Sickness had caused, gives every one unspeakable Pleasure.
  M. de Langeron repairs thither likewise; he never
  fails to come thither every Day on Horseback, in the
  Morning and Afternoon, be what Weather it will, and
  sits generally till eight a Clock at Night; 'tis most frequently
  after he has taken his Rounds to the Hospitals,
  the Pits, the Church-yards, and other Places very dangerous
  to approach, which he will view with his own
  Eyes, and where he exposes himself without Regard to
  his Health or Life.</p>
<p>The 14<sup>th</sup>, the Sheriffs continue to appear constantly,
  each at the Head of one of the Brigades of Slaves, with
  the Carts, to set them to work in different Quarters, to
  take up and carry to the Pits that prodigious Number
  of dead Bodies, with which the City is filled; and
  though they take away so many, they find more still, by
  the Continuance of the Mortality.</p>
<p>But there is one Part, where they have not been
  able to set foot yet; it is at an Esplanade called la
  Tourette, which lies towards the Sea, between the
  Houses and the Rampart, from Fort St. John to
  the Church of Major: There lie extended about a thousand
  dead Bodies close to each other, the freshest of
  which have lain there above three Weeks; so that had
  they not been infected, the lying so long in a Place exposed
  to the hot Sun all the Day, might have sufficed
  to render them contagious: All one's Senses are affected
  at approaching a Place, whence one smells afar off
  the contagious Vapours which Exhale from it: Nature
  shrinks, and the firmest Eyes cannot bear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> hideous a Sight; those Bodies have no longer any human
  Form, they are Monsters that give Horror, and one
  would think all their Limbs stir, the Worms are in such
  Motion about them.</p>
<p>Nothing however is of more urgent Necessity than
  to remove these Bodies from that Place; every Moment
  they are let lye there, furnishes Exhalations which must
  poison the Air; but how shall they be taken up and carried
  to the Pits without the Town, which are at a very
  great Distance? Bodies so putrefied will not hold in the
  Carts; the Entrails, the Limbs which are loosened at
  the Joints by the Worms, would run out, or drop off,
  which would scatter the Plague and Venom quite through
  the City.</p>
<p>The Chevalier Rose, who is good at Expedients, and
  as industrious as intrepid, goes to the Place, and viewing
  the Rampart, perceives that two antient Bastions,
  which about two thousand Years ago stood the Attacks
  of Julius C�sar's Army, and are near the Esplanade where
  lye the dead Bodies, tho' they seem to be filled with
  Earth, are vaulted within, which he discovers at the
  Foot of one of them through a Hole, which Time
  has made in a Stone; he presently imagines that no
  more needs be done, than to take away some Foot of
  Earth which cover the Vault of each Bastion, to break
  into that Vault, and finding them quite hollow within
  down to the Foundation which is level with the Surface
  of the Sea, nothing is more easy than to cast all
  those Bodies into them, and then to cover them with
  as much Earth and Lime as is necessary, to hinder the
  exhaling of any Infection from them.</p>
<p>This being so judiciously projected, he returns to
  the Town-house, and tells M. de Langeron and the
  Sheriffs, that he will take upon him to remove all the
  dead Bodies from la Tourette, explains to them his Project,
  they find it admirable; but to be able to execute
  it, a greater Number of Slaves must be employed,
  that it may be done suddenly and at once; it being evident,
  that no Soul that breathes can hold out above a
  few Minutes in so noisome a Place, when those Bodies
  are moved, to be drawn off the Ground and thrown
  into the Bastions. M. de Langeron, who has newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> received Orders from Court, to take as many Slaves
  out of the Gallies as he shall judge necessary for the
  Service of the City, promises him a hundred for this
  Enterprize.</p>
<p>The same Day the Mortality continues without Decrease,
  and all the several Pits which had been opened
  being filled, M. de Langeron accompanied by M. Moustier, and the Chevalier de Soissans, take a Turn
  without the City, to see what Place will be most convenient
  for opening new ones speedily; and some are
  marked out on the Side of the Gate of Aix, of sixty
  Foot long and thirty broad: At the same time the Question
  being where to get at least a hundred Peasants to dig them;
  M. de Langeron sends all his Guards into the Territory,
  with Orders to the Captains of the principal Quarters
  to make them come, either willingly, or by Force.</p>
<p>The 15<sup>th</sup>, he issues an Ordinance, commanding all
  the Intendants of Health, Counsellors of the City,
  Captains of Quarters, and Commissaries of Parishes,
  who have deserted, to return within twenty four Hours
  to their Functions, on Pain of Disobedience.</p>
<p>He sets forth another, jointly with the Marquess de
  Pilles and the Sheriffs, prescribing all that ought to
  be done, observed, and executed in the Territory, where
  the Plague makes likewise very great Ravages, and has
  got into all the Quarters.</p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup>, to remove that horrible Infection which is
  in the Port, by above ten thousand dead Dogs floating
  in it, he sends for the Regulators of the Fishermen to
  the Town-house, and Orders them to work with Boats
  to inclose them in Nets, and draw them so far without
  the Chain, that the Current of the Water may not bring
  them in again.</p>
<p>This Day the Chevalier Rose, who the Day before
  had caused the Vaults of the two Bastions of the Rampart de la Tourette to be broken into, and found them
  hollow to the Foundation as he had foreseen, having received
  the hundred Slaves appointed to remove the dead
  Bodies from that Part, causes each of them to tye a
  Handkerchief dipped in Vinegar about his Head to stop
  his Nose, and having disposed them in such a manner,
  as to be able to put all Hands to the Work at once, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> makes them in half an Hour take away all those Bodies,
  Limbs of which dropped off in carrying, and
  throw them into the Caverns of those Bastions, which
  he immediately causes to be filled with Lime and Earth,
  up to the Level of the Esplanade.</p>
<p>The 17<sup>th</sup>, the Sheriffs continuing with yet greater Ardour
  and Zeal, to go each at the Head of a Number of
  Carts, to see the dead Bodies taken up and carried off,
  from the several Streets of the Town, which are more
  and more filled with them; M. Estelle has Notice that
  the Pits which had been filled on the Side of la Major,
  had cleft in the Night; he hastens thither to see them
  repaired, and takes with him the Peasants who were
  working at the new Pits without the Gate of Aix:
  But there's no governing the Peasants at approaching
  infected Places, the Soldiers of the Gallies who accompany
  them drive them on, but they give back; he
  takes a Pick-ax himself and falls to work to encourage
  them; they are not to be stimulated by his Example,
  the Soldiers are, they instantly lay down their Arms,
  wrest the Pick-ax out of his Hands, take each of them
  one from those dastardly Peasants, and repair the Pits,
  notwithstanding the Infection, with inexpressible Ardour:
  It is Pity all those Soldiers perished, they served
  the City with a Zeal which will make them always lamented.</p>
<p>This Day M. Audimar causes a Heap of Bodies,
  which were piled up in the Street of Ferrat, and were
  no less putrid than those of la Tourette, to be carried
  off.</p>
<p>M. de Langeron studying to relieve the Necessities of
  the People, who are in want of all Things, and who
  suffer and even perish by the Desertion of almost all the
  Surgeons, Apothecaries, Retailers of common Necessaries,
  as Cooks and others, whose Shops and Stalls are
  generally shut up every where; he publishes an Ordinance
  to compel them to return within twenty four
  Hours precisely, on Pain of Death.</p>
<p>The same Day the Physicians of Montpellier who had
  come in the Month of August, to examine by Order of
  his Royal Highness, the Nature and Symptoms of the
  Distemper, come again, accompanied by M. Soulliers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> Master Surgeon to the King, who was also with them
  the first time; after their Departure from hence, they
  had resided at a Country-house near Aix which had been
  appointed for them to perform Quarantain in, which
  done they were to have been admitted into Montpellier;
  but his Royal Highness being desirous to succour Marseilles,
  and judging that such a Distemper required the
  most eminent and skilful Physicians, was pleased to
  send them new Orders to return hither, and join with
  them M. Deidier another famous Physician and Professor
  of Montpellier, who arrived with them.</p>
<p>The Plague had till then been treated as the Plague,
  the Sick presently judged of the Danger of their Sickness
  by the Behaviour of the Physicians who visited them:
  M. de Chicoyneau, Chancellor of the University of Montpellier,
  M. Verny, and M. Deidier, give them Reason
  to believe, on the contrary, that 'tis of all Distempers the
  least dangerous and the most common; they approach
  them without the least Concern or Mark of Emotion,
  without Repugnance, without Precaution; they even sit
  down upon their Beds, touch their Buboes and Sores, and
  stay by them calmly as long as is necessary to inform
  themselves of the State of their Case, the Symptoms of
  their Distemper, and to see the Surgeons perform the
  Operations they order: They go every where, and pass
  through all the Quarters, they examine the Sick, in the
  Streets, in the publick Places, in the Houses, and in the
  Hospitals; one would think them invulnerable, or tutelar
  Angels sent by God to save every poor Creature's
  Life; they refuse the Money the Rich offer them; nor
  receive any thing from any body, but a thousand Blessings
  from all; their Manner of proceeding, with the
  Reputation of their Names, recover the Sick by the
  Hope and Confidence they raise in them.</p>
<p>The 18<sup>th</sup>, another Pit is opened, below the Ramparts
  between the Gate of Aix and the Tower of St. Paule,
  sixty Foot long and thirty broad: M. de Langeron wrote
  the Day before to the Captains of the Territory, to send
  in Peasants: The Chevalier de Soissans goes at Day break
  to the Entrance of the Suburbs, to conduct them to this
  Work, which they were extremely averse to, because of
  the Nearness of other Pits already filled thereabouts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> New ones are also opened on the Side of that Ground,
  by which the Church-yard of the Parish of St. Ferriol was formerly enlarged; this Quarter is the finest and
  best Inhabited of the City, where M. Serre, no less a
  good Citizen than a famous and excellent Painter, one
  of the Commissaries appointed there, zealous even to
  the Sacrificing of his own Life for the Relief of his
  Country, has taken upon himself alone the laborious
  and perillous Care to see carried off and buried, the dead
  Bodies from thence, with some Carts which the Sheriffs
  have given him, and a Brigade of Slaves put under
  his Direction by the Officers of the Gallies, whom he
  carefully subsists and lodges at his own Expence. A
  Citizen that so loves his Country, deserves to be beloved
  by it.</p>
<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> the Desertion from the City continuing, so
  that none can be found to carry into the Store-houses
  of the Community the Corn brought up by Boats from
  the Barrier of Lestaque, M. de Langeron appoints for
  that Service twenty six Gally-Slaves, with four of their
  Companions to dress Victuals for them; no Persons
  being found fit to be put to do so much as that.</p>
<p>The time of Vintage approaching, it is considered
  that the Vapours of the new Wine, in a Town where
  so prodigious a Quantity is made, might contribute very
  much towards dis-infecting the Houses; and it is called
  to mind that it was by this Means the last Plague which
  afflicted Marseilles was stopt: Whereupon an Ordinance
  is issued, in the Names of M. de Langeron, the Marquess de Pilles, and the Sheriffs, importing that the
  Vintage shall be got in as usual.</p>
<p>This Day arrive three other Physicians of the Faculty
  of Montpellier, who came Post from Paris by
  Order of his Royal Highness, viz. M. Mailhes Professor
  of the University of Cahors, M. Boyer de Paradis of Marseilles, and M. de L�badie, accompanied by two
  Master-Surgeons of Paris: They are provided with
  excellent Instructions, which they received from M. Chirac first Physician to his Royal Highness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> Sur-Intendant of the Royal Physick-Garden, who has
  not neglected any thing that might be for the Relief of
  this unfortunate City: Physicians so well chosen, and
  so well instructed, cannot fail of doing good Service;
  the Event will soon shew it.</p>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup>, there are no Medicines nor Drugs to be
  found in the City, by Reason of the Flight and Desertion
  of all the Apothecaries, Druggists, and Grocers;
  the Sick dye without being able to use the Liberty of
  making their Wills, the Royal Notaries having all
  fled; Women with Child are delivered without any
  Assistance, the Midwives being all fled likewise: An
  Ordinance at my Instance is issued by M. de Langeron,
  the Marquess de Pilles, and the Sheriffs, to oblige them
  all to return within twenty four Hours on Pain of
  Death: The Royal Notaries only obey readily. The
  ordinary Term of letting or quitting Houses being Michaelmas-Day, and almost all the Houses being
  infected, it would be dangerous to suffer such removing
  with Houshold-Goods mostly infected; another Ordinance
  forbids it, till it be otherwise ordered.</p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup>, the Sheriffs have an Increase of Care and
  Trouble; the Persons who for a long time had the
  Direction and Management of the Office of Plenty of
  Corn, and of the Shambles, dye of the Plague; this
  obliges the Sheriffs to take that Business upon themselves,
  while they have so much already upon their
  Hands: M. de Langeron, to facilitate their going
  through with it all, persuades them to take each a certain
  part of the Work: Accordingly, M. Estelle is
  charged with the Dispatch of all the current Affairs at
  the Town-House, with the Correspondences, and with
  the Orders for the good Government of the City; M. Audimar with the Shambles; M. Moustier with all that
  relates to the carrying off and burying of the Dead,
  the Pits, and the Church-yards, the cleaning of the
  Streets, the Carts, the Gally Slaves and their Subsistance;
  and M. Dieud� with what relates to Bread-Corn,
  Meal, Wood for firing, and the Bakers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>The 22<sup>d</sup>, new Pits are to be made, M. de Langeron sends his Guards into the Territory, to bring in one
  hundred and fifty Men to dig them; and the 23<sup>d</sup> one
  is opened of one hundred thirty two Foot long, forty
  eight wide, and fourteen deep, in the Garden of the
  Observantines near the Ramparts.</p>
<p>The 24<sup>th</sup>, at the Time when Misery and Calamity
  are at the Heighth; when all is groaning, lamenting,
  dying, as well in the Country, as in the Town; when
  those whom the Fury of the Distemper has spared, are
  overtaken by Famine, and fall into Despair, more
  cruel and terrible than the Plague it self; when the
  Fountains of Charity, which had run till now, are dried
  up; when, as the Scripture expresses it, the Heavens seem
  to be of Brass, and the Earth of Iron; and when no Hope
  at all remain'd, but of Dying; 'tis then a charitable
  Hand extends it self from afar to this unhappy City.</p>
<p>The 25<sup>th</sup>, the Heaps of infected Cloaths and Houshold-Goods,
  with which all the Streets are incumbered,
  being a greater hindrance to the passing through
  them, than the dead Bodies and Sick that lye in them;
  Mons. de Langeron sets twenty five Gally-Slaves to
  work, to carry all off in Carts, and twenty others to
  cleave Wood for Firing, for the Use of the Bakers; no
  other Hands being to be had.</p>
<p>The Refractoriness of the Apothecaries, Druggists,
  and Grocers, in absenting themselves from the City,
  and the Necessity of compelling them to return, that
  the Sick may be supplied with Medicines and Drugs,
  oblige him to send Guards into the Territory, to seize
  and bring away the chief of them.</p>
<p>The 26<sup>th</sup>, the Hospital of Timber-work in the Alleys
  of the Grand Mall, and which so many Poor infected,
  who lie in the Streets and publick Places, have
  been wishing for several Days, is upon the Point of
  being finished, after incredible Labour; when a North
  Wind, the most violent that ever was, blows so hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> that it breaks and throws down almost all the Timber-work,
  with the Sail-cloth that covered it: For repairing
  speedily this Damage, M. de Langeron goes thither,
  sends for robust and serviceable Fellows from the
  Gallies, with Officers to keep them diligently employed;
  the Sheriffs bestir themselves to provide more Timber
  and Sail-cloth; all Hands are at Work; the Chevalier de Soissans keeps upon the Spot, to encourage the
  Men, and give Orders, accompanied by M. Marin and Beaussier, Commissaries appointed to act as Directors
  General of this Hospital, who sacrificed their Time
  and private Concerns to see it built, were always active
  in any thing that was most toilsome; and the principal
  Assistants of the Sheriffs, from the Time the Fear of the
  Contagion made every body abandon them.</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup>, it is considered, that as large as this Hospital
  is, it cannot serve for such a Multitude of Sick,
  as are lying in all the Streets, and encreased daily by
  the Continuance of the Distemper; and therefore another
  must be timely thought of: After looking about
  every where, it is resolved to make use of the Hospital
  General de la Charit�, which is in perfect Readiness,
  actually furnished with near 800 Beds, and all necessary
  Utensils.</p>
<p>The Difficulty is, whither to remove the Poor maintained
  in it: No Place seems so proper as the H�tel-Dieu,
  where there is Room enough; but there have
  been infected Patients in it, and above fifty are so
  now; they must be first removed, and the House disinfected
  (or perfumed;) those Patients are carried to a
  Chapel of the Penitents, which is hard by; and M. Estelle performs the Disinfection with all requisite Exactness.</p>
<p>From the 28<sup>th</sup> of September to the 3<sup>d</sup> of October, nothing
  but Action and Labour Night and Day. At the Mall no Time is lost to repair the Damage done by
  the Wind, and to provide for such an Hospital the infinite
  Number of Things necessary in it; in fitting up
  Apartments and Laboratories for the Physicians, Apo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>thecaries,
  Surgeons, Officers, and Servants of the Hospital,
  in the Convent of the Reformed Augustines,
  which is contiguous to it, and in the neighbouring Bastides;
  and in digging near it large and deep Pits: At la
  Charit�, those already opened in the Garden of the Observantines are just behind it; but for that Hospital, it
  was found to require more Trouble than the other to
  provide it with all Necessaries. The Pains taken to
  disinfect the H�tel-Dieu, remove from thence the
  infected Patients, and bring into it all the Poor from la Charit�, are inconceivable: M. de Langeron is obliged
  to be on Horseback from Morning to Night,
  moving from Place to Place; the Sheriffs give themselves
  no Respite, but shorten the common Time of
  Meals, that they may not lose a Moment. Every thing
  is hard to be got, even Straw to stuff the Mattresses,
  which no body will bring in from the Territory, without
  being compelled to it by Force. Officers and Servants
  must be sought for all these Hospitals; especially
  a great Number of Surgeons must be had, both Masters
  and Men; they cannot be drawn hither from other Provinces,
  but by exorbitant Rewards; Advertisements are
  affixed every where, promising to all Surgeons who
  will come, viz. to Master-Surgeons of Principal
  Towns 2000 Livres a Month; to the licensed Surgeons
  of those Towns, and the Master-Surgeons of small
  Places 1000 Livres a Month; and to their Apprentices,
  or Journeymen, 300 Livres a Month, with the Freedom
  of the Company of Surgeons of Marseilles; besides
  Lodging and Diet all the time they are employed.</p>
<p>The 3<sup>d</sup> of October, Part of the Troops which M. de
  Langeron expected for the Service of the City, and to
  execute his Orders, arrive; viz. Three Companies of
  the Regiment of Flandres, whom he causes to encamp
  at the Chartreuse without the Walls.</p>
<p>The 4<sup>th</sup>, the two new Hospitals at the Mall and la
  Charit�, are, at length, in a Condition to receive the
  Sick; and immediately they creep thither from all
  Quarters. A Number of Gally-Slaves is employed to
  fetch those who cannot help themselves, and are ly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ing
  in the publick Places and Streets, and in the
  Houses.</p>
<p>The 5<sup>th</sup>, all the Physicians, as well Strangers, as of
  Faculty in this City, are convened at the Town-House,
  in the Presence of M. de Langeron, the Marquess
  de Pilles, and the Sheriffs; and M. de Chicoyneau and Verny, as Principals, and those others to whom
  the general Inspection is committed, appoint the Stations
  where each shall serve, and the Surgeons to be
  employed under them. If all the Strangers have signalized
  themselves by their Skill and Zeal, those of
  the City have equall'd them in both; they have served
  with so little Care of their own Persons, that three of
  them have lost their Lives, M. Peissonel, Montagnier,
  and Audan, and a fourth, Mr. Bertrand, was very near
  Death's Door.</p>
<p>The 6<sup>th</sup>, three of the Captains of the City dying, the
  Sheriffs nominate in their Room M. Desperier, Bonnaneau,
  and Icard, who from the Beginning of the
  Contagion have voluntarily gone upon any Service,
  however toilsome and hazardous, for the City.</p>
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup>, the Plague being more violent in the Territory
  than in the City, and it being of Importance to
  hinder the Sick to come from thence into it; M. de
  Langeron posts at each Gate a Corps de Garde of Soldiers
  of the King's Troops, under the Command of the
  Captains and Officers of the Town; and publishes an
  Ordinance, which prescribes the Rules to be observed
  at any Person's coming into, or going out of the
  Gates.</p>
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup>, whereas since the two new Hospitals have
  been opened, the Sick are no longer lying about the
  Streets, and the dead Bodies are carried off daily, by
  the great Number of Carts which are continually passing;
  Dispositions are made for cleaning the Streets
  throughout the City, as well for making Room to pass,
  as to take away the horrible Infection caused by the
  prodigious Quantity of Filth and Nastiness, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> they are all covered. For this Purpose large Boats,
  used for cleansing the Port, by taking up the Soil, are
  placed all along the Key at each Pallisade; and while
  the Sheriffs go each through a Quarter with a Brigade
  of Gally Slaves, to cause all the Heaps of infected
  Cloaths and Houshold-Goods, which have been thrown
  out of the Windows, to be burnt; other Brigades of
  Slaves go with Carts, to take up the Dunghills and
  Filth, which they shoot into those Boats, and these
  carry it out, and throw it into the Sea, as far as they
  can from the Mouth of the Port: This is so tedious a
  Work, that be it followed never so close, it will take
  up a Month at least to finish it.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup>, the Sheriffs receive News that fills them
  with Joy and Consolation; they find by a Letter which
  the Consuls of Avignon are so kind to write to them,
  that the common Father of the Faithful Roman Catholicks,
  moved at hearing of the Calamities of a City,
  which was the first of all Gaul that received the Catholick
  Faith, by St. Lazarus its first Bishop; which in
  all Times has preserved it in its Purity, no Heresy having
  ever been able to get footing in it; and which has always
  had a singular Attachment, with a profound and
  inviolable Respect, for the Holy See; has not thought it
  enough to order publick Prayers in all the Churches
  of Rome, and Processions, at which his Holiness assists
  on Foot, to beseech the Sovereign Father of Mercies
  to appease his Wrath against Marseilles, and cast away
  the dreadful Scourge which lays it desolate; but being
  desirous to succour so many miserable Poor as are in
  it, and supply them with Bread in their Need, has caused
  to be bought up in the District of Ancona two thousand
  Measures (called Roubies) of Bread-Corn, which
  will be forthwith brought hither by Vessels that are to
  take it in at Civita-Vecchia, to be distributed to the Poor
  in such Proportions as the Bishop shall allot.</p>
<p>The 10<sup>th</sup>, the Canons of the Collegiate Church of
  St. Martin, having Benefices with Cure of Souls, persisting
  to absent themselves from their Duty, notwithstanding
  the several Admonitions signified to them, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> Bishop pronounces Sentence, and, conformably to the
  Petition of the Sheriffs of the 4<sup>th</sup> of September last, declares
  their Benefices vacant, and that they shall be filled
  with others duly qualified; and he nominates to them
  accordingly.</p>
<p>The 11<sup>th</sup>, there are in the Hospitals several Patients
  who have the Happiness to recover of the Plague: A
  Place is necessary for these to be removed to, where
  they may stay forty Days after their Buboes and Sores
  are entirely cured and healed up; it is resolv'd to make
  use of the grand Infirmaries for this Purpose; they must
  be made ready, and provided with all Things necessary:
  M. de Langeron goes thither, with M. Estelle, and Orders
  are given for doing it out of hand.</p>
<p>The 12<sup>th</sup>, more Troops arrive for the Service of the
  City; viz. Three Companies of the Regiment of Brie,
  which M. de Langeron causes to encamp at the Chartreuse,
  with the three others already there.</p>
<p>The 13<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup>, while the Infirmaries are getting
  ready for those who are recover'd from the Plague,
  he sends Orders into the Territory, to compel those
  Intendants of Health, who have absented themselves,
  and several other Municipal Officers, whose Service is
  absolutely requisite in the City, to return.</p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup>, he posts a Corps de Garde of thirty Soldiers
  by the Town-House, to guard the Sheriffs, and execute
  Orders.</p>
<p>The 17<sup>th</sup>, it is resolved to send into the Infirmaries,
  not only those who have recovered in the several Hospitals,
  but likewise all those who wander about the
  City with their Buboes broke and running, and communicate
  the Contagion generally to those who, not
  knowing their Condition, have the Misfortune to touch
  or approach them.</p>
<p>The 18<sup>th</sup>, the Difficulties which obstruct the putting
  the Infirmaries intirely into Order; or closing up the
  Sides of the Market-House, which are open; Timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> Boards, and Sail-Cloth being not to be had; make it necessary
  to seek some other Place, which is already in
  proper Order; such appears to be the College of the
  Fathers de l'Oratoire, the Halls of which are capable of
  harbouring a great Number of Persons; and Lodgings
  for the Officers, Surgeons, and Servants, are ready in
  the rest of the House, which is quite empty by the
  Flight of those Priests.</p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup>, the Grand Claustral Prior (i.e. he that resides,
  and keeps the Monks to their Duty) of the Abbey of
  St. Victor, and two Monks deputed from that Chapter,
  come to the Town-House to justify themselves upon
  their Refusal to carry in Procession the Shrines and
  Reliques of their Church, to the Square of the Loge.
  The Continuance of the Contagion, notwithstanding
  all the Efforts hitherto made to stop it, leaving no
  Hope, but in the Mercy of the Almighty through the
  Intercession of the Saints, the Sheriffs resolved to desire
  the Bishop to cause all the Shrines of Saints, and
  all the Reliques of the Church of Major to be brought
  forth, and to accompany them to the Square of the Loge,
  where they design'd to erect a great Altar, on which
  to place them in open View, and likewise to desire the
  Monks of the Abbey of St. Victor, to bring out at the
  same Time all the Shrines and Reliques of their Church,
  and to accompany them to the same Place, where being
  all ranged together on the same Altar, the Bishop
  was to celebrate Mass, and all the Prayers prescribed
  against the Plague were to be said. The Bishop instantly
  agreed to it, with all the Joy and Satisfaction which
  the Piety that animates him could raise: M. de Langeron had given the most proper Orders, for preventing any
  Crowd, or even any Communication, at this Holy
  Procession; nothing remained, but to dispose the Monks
  of the Abbey of St. Victor to perform their Part: M. Estelle went, and moved it to them; they consent, but
  on Conditions utterly impracticable: They demand,
  either that two Altars should be erected, or that the
  Bishop should not celebrate Mass, lest their Privileges
  should receive some Diminution by it. And their Grand
  Prior Claustral, with two Monks of the Abbey, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> to Day to the Town-house, to have it understood that
  their Reasons were solid, and not Pretexts.</p>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup>, no Bell having been rung in the Town
  since the Contagion, not even that which warns the
  Soldiers and Townsmen to retire to their Houses and
  Quarters at Night, M. de Langeron orders it to be rung
  as formerly.</p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup>, he orders the Officers of the City to go the
  Rounds punctually in all the Quarters, with the Number
  of Soldiers appointed by him.</p>
<p>The 22<sup>d</sup> and 23<sup>d</sup>, the Prisons being filled with Malefactors,
  and the Effects of a vast Number of Houses
  being exposed to Robbery, by the Death of all the Persons
  who inhabited them; he sends Orders into the
  Territory, to oblige the Commissaries de Police to return,
  to bring to Tryal those Malefactors, and to secure
  those Effects for the lawful Claimants.</p>
<p>The 24<sup>th</sup> M. de Langeron, the Marquess de Pilles and
  the Sheriffs, publish an Ordinance at my Instance, commanding
  all those who have taken into their Possession
  the Keys of Houses, or the Effects of Persons
  deceased, or who have had them put into their Hands
  in Trust, of what Nature soever they are, to appear
  within twenty four Hours at the Town-House, and
  make Declaration thereof before the Commissaries de
  Police, that the same may be properly secured.</p>
<p>The 25<sup>th</sup> another Ordinance is issued for the Publick
  Safety and Health, importing, that for preventing Robberies
  in the Night, and the Increase of the Contagion
  by removing from one Place to another infected Apparel,
  those who after ringing the warning Bell at
  Night shall be taken robbing Houses, or removing Apparel,
  or Houshold Goods, shall be punish'd with Death;
  and that those who shall have forbidden Arms found upon
  them, shall be condemned to the Gallies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>The 26<sup>th</sup>, tho' the Plague seems to have decreased,
  want of Provisions increases; the Distemper having got
  into the neighbouring Places, and even into the Capital
  of the Province, hardly any Corn or other Necessaries
  are brought any longer to the Markets at the
  Barriers; even all the Barriers are chang'd and remov'd
  so far off, that they are out of reach, and Marseilles is
  in the greatest Extremities that it ever felt. M. de Langeron and the Sheriffs see the Necessity there is, for
  avoiding a speedy Famine, to send Vessels to divers
  Parts to fetch Bread-Corn, and other Provisions; but
  having neither Money nor Means to procure any, they
  are obliged to send Dispatches to Court for Supplies.</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> the Hospitals of the Mall, of La Charit�,
  and of the Rive Neuve, being by the Decrease of the
  Distemper more than sufficient to hold all the Sick;
  and that des Convalescens being become altogether superfluous,
  it is resolv'd to make Use of it for those who
  have recovered, and not of the College de l'Oratoire,
  as was design'd.</p>
<p>The 28<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> are spent in putting it in Order and
  Furnishing it with new Beds, after all the Sick who
  were in it had been remov'd to the Hospital at the Mall.</p>
<p>The 30<sup>th</sup> the great Number of Surgeons, as well
  Masters as others, who are come from all Parts,
  allur'd by the Advertisements of the 30<sup>th</sup> of September,
  that had been sent out to be publickly affix'd every where,
  which promised great Rewards to those that would
  come and serve; makes it necessary to publish contrary
  Advertisements, signifying, that the Distemper having
  happily decreased very much, there is no further Occasion
  for them.</p>
<p>The 31<sup>th</sup>, to get together, in Order to confine and
  put under Quarantain, those who have recovered from
  the Plague, who with their Buboes broke and running
  wander about the Streets and infect all whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> approach, the Chevalier de Soissans finds out a very
  easy Expedient; they are all necessitous People who
  beg about, and do not fail to go wherever Alms are
  distributed daily to all Comers; he orders Soldiers to
  hide themselves near the House whither the Bishop has
  retir'd; in less than half an Hour above five hundred
  of these Beggars flock thither, whom the Soldiers
  surround and carry to the Hospital des Convalescens,
  where the Surgeons search them, and detain all who
  ought to be kept there.</p>
<p>The First of November, being the Feast of all Saints,
  the Bishop comes out of his Palace in Procession, accompany'd
  by the Canons of the Church des Acoulles,
  by those whom he has newly nominated Canons of
  the Church of St. Martin, and by the Parson and
  Priests of the Parish of St. Ferriol; and chusing to appear
  like the Scape Goat, loaded with the Sins of all
  the People, and like a Victim destin'd to expiate them,
  he walks with a Halter about his Neck, the Cross in
  his Arms, and bare-Foot; thus he proceeds by the
  Ring towards the Gate of Aix, where he celebrates
  Mass publickly, at an Altar which he had caused to be
  erected; and after a pathetick Exhortation to the People
  to move them to Repentance, for appeasing the Wrath
  of God, and obtaining Deliverance from the raging
  Pestilence; he pronounces a solemn Consecration of
  the City to the sacred Heart of Jesus, in Honour of
  which he had instituted a Festival to be kept yearly by a
  Mandate which he caus'd to be read: The Tears which
  are seen running down his Cheeks during this devout
  Ceremony, join'd to his very moving Expressions, excite
  Compunction in the most obdurate Hearts, and
  every one pierc'd with unfeigned Sorrow cries to the
  Lord for Mercy: St. Charles did the like formerly at Milan on the same Festival of all Saints, when that
  City was under the Calamity of the Plague; and nothing
  is wanting to this Imitator of the Zeal, Piety,
  Charity, and all the Virtues of so great a Saint, but the Roman Purple which he deserves, and which a whole
  People on whom he heaps spiritual and temporal Blessings,
  wish him from the bottom of their Hearts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>From the second to the fifth, M. de Langeron with
  the Sheriffs divide all the Quarters of the Town into
  new Districts, and appoint at every District, containing
  a certain number of Houses, a Commissary to see
  to the Execution of the several Orders issued, and to
  prevent whatever may contribute to the Continuance of
  the Plague, or to its Return.</p>
<p>The 5<sup>th</sup>, for restraining the excessive Price of all Provisions,
  which is raised every Day by those who take
  Advantage of the general Scarcity, they hold in the
  Town-house an Assembly of Merchants and Tradesmen
  to settle a general Rate; they continue drawing it up
  the next Day, and the 8<sup>th</sup> they publish an Ordinance
  forbidding all Shopkeepers, Retailers, and Regraters,
  to sell at a higher Price than what is specified in that
  general Rate, on the Penalty of the Pillory, of Refunding
  the Money taken, and Confiscation of the Goods
  sold.</p>
<p>From the 6<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> M. de Langeron sends out
  Orders on all Sides for regulating and relieving all the
  Quarters of the Territory, where the Plague continues
  to rage; and the 14<sup>th</sup> he publishes an Ordinance with the
  Marquess de Pilles and the Sheriffs, which prescribes
  such exact and judicious Precautions to be observ'd at
  the Gates, that the indispensible Commerce between
  the City and the Territory is maintain'd, and yet the
  Distemper which is there cannot any way be brought
  into the City, to make that which still continues here
  rage the more.</p>
<p>The 15<sup>th</sup>, the Bakers having almost spent all the Fuel
  for their Ovens, so that they must leave off Baking,
  Vessels are sent towards Toulon to fetch Wood.</p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup> the Bishop takes a holy Resolution to exorcise
  the Plague, which he has the Grief to see continue:
  In order to this, having called together the Remains
  of his Clergy in the Church des Acoulles, he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>gins
  by causing all the Prayers to be read which his Holiness
  had sent to him, and which are daily repeated in
  all the Churches of Rome, to incline the Almighty to
  deliver Marseilles from this Scourge; and after a very
  eloquent and very moving Exhortation, he carries up
  the Holy Sacrament to the Leads over the Roof of the
  Church, from whence all the City and its Territory lye
  open to the View, gives his Benediction, and performs
  the Exorcism against the Plague, with all the Prayers
  and Ceremonies which the Church has prescribed.</p>
<p>The 17<sup>th</sup>, M. de Langeron receives an Answer from
  Court, to the Dispatches he had sent thither: M. le
  Blanc, and M. le Pelletier des Forts write to him, that
  his Royal Highness being extremely concerned at the
  Calamity of Marseilles, had given Orders to the India Company to remit hither twenty five thousand Pieces
  of Eight, and one thousand nine hundred Marks of
  Silver, with which he is pleased to assist this City, till
  he can provide for its further Relief: The Marquess de la Vrilliere writes the same thing to the Sheriffs, and
  that his Royal Highness will do all that lies in his Power
  to succour them: That August Prince has had all possible
  Regard for this unfortunate City; from the Time
  he knew of its Distress, he has not neglected sending
  Orders every where, for supplying it with all necessary
  Help, as well to cure the Distemper, as to provide
  against Scarcity and Want: All his Ministers have seconded
  his Intentions with so much Earnestness and
  Application, that they seem to have had no other Business
  upon their Hands, than to hasten its Supplies, and
  to render them effectual. What Gratitude for this will
  not Subjects so obedient and so faithful ever cherish in
  their Hearts? This Gratitude for their Preservation,
  joined to the Ardour and Zeal which have always distinguished
  them in the Submission and Obedience due to
  his Majesty; will inflame them with a Desire to sacrifice
  their Lives and Fortunes, for the Honour and Glory
  of his Service.</p>
<p>Never was there greater Scarcity, nor ever was such
  Scarcity so plentifully supplied; so that having been con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>tinually
  just falling into Want, or in fear of wanting
  every thing, by the Interdiction of Communication and
  Commerce, we have hardly ever wanted any thing, by
  Means of the continual Succours which came in successively
  from all Parts, by the Orders of his Royal
  Highness, and the particular Care of M. le Pelletier
  des Forts, and M. le Blanc, to cause them to be executed:
  Corn and other Provisions, and especially large
  Cattle, and Sheep, have been brought in such Quantity
  and Numbers, notwithstanding all Difficulties, that
  for a long time we have had a kind of Plenty of them;
  from the Mint at Aix, the first President has remitted
  very considerable Sums of Money, he has procured all
  Necessaries to be sent in from divers Parts; he has caused
  almost whole Forests to be cut down, that we
  might not want Wood for firing; and not contenting
  himself with procuring Credit for us to a great Sum,
  he has had the Goodness to find Means to discharge a
  considerable Part of that Debt; from Languedoc the
  Intendant, M. de Bernage, has taken infinite Pains to get
  sent hither all the Succours that fertile Province could
  furnish.</p>
<p>Several eminent Citizens have contributed very largely;
  M. Constans and Remusat, have by their Credit and
  Money procured twenty thousand Measures (called Charges) of Bread-Corn; M. Martins, Grimaud,
  and Beoland, have voluntarily taken inconceivable Pains
  so keep the Shambles supplied, and with very great Success;
  several others have contributed Money for buying
  up Corn in the Levant; even some of the Magistrates
  of the Soveraign Courts of the Province, as soon as the
  Plague had broke out, moved by their Generosity of
  Heart, and Grandeur of Soul, offered and even sent in
  all the Corn that was reaped on their own Lands;
  such are M. de Lubieres and de Ricardi, Counsellors of
  the Parliament, and M. de Rauville President of the
  Court of Accompts, Aids and Finances: We could not
  perish with so great and various Supplies; but Marseilles and its Territory are an Abyss; it cannot otherwise
  be filled, than by that prodigious Abundance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> which Liberty, and the Concourse of the Commerce of
  Nations, bring into it.</p>
<p>The 18<sup>th</sup> M. Taxil, Agent of the India Company at Marseilles, remits to the Sheriffs one thousand six
  hundred Marks of Bullion, and twenty thousand and
  forty nine Marks in Pieces of Eight, which they cause
  to be conveyed to the Mint at Montpellier, there to be
  converted into new Specie.</p>
<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> the Distemper which had extremely decreased,
  having increased again a little, and there being
  Ground to believe that the Communication in some
  Churches which were opened, had occasioned it, the
  Bishop is desired to be pleased to order them to be shut up
  again.</p>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, and 22<sup>d</sup> Vessels are fitted out to fetch
  Corn from the Levant, that we might not be wholly
  in want of it this Winter, and after the Plague and
  Scarcity fall into Famine.</p>
<p>The 23<sup>d</sup> Advice comes that one of the Vessels in
  which his Holiness's Ministers had caused to be laden
  at Civita-Vecchia, the Bread-Corn designed for the Poor
  of Marseilles, is unhappily wrecked on the Island of Porcherolles, and that of one thousand Measures it carried,
  not three hundred could be saved.</p>
<p>The 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup>, the Contagion still continuing
  in the Territory, and the Persons who live there, or
  have retired thither, especially those who are struck
  with it, or suspect they are, using all manner of Artifice
  to steal into the City, where the Distemper has almost
  intirely ceased, M. de Langeron establishes such
  proper and exact Precautions, that no Endeavours of
  that kind can succeed.</p>
<p>The 26<sup>th</sup> he publishes an Ordinance, to serve for
  Rules at the Gates, prescribing the several Certificates
  which must be brought to obtain Permission to enter,
  and describing the Condition of Health and other Cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>cumstances
  a Person must be in to be qualified for a
  Certificate from the Parish-Priests, Captains, and Commissaries.</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> he sends this Ordinance to be published in
  the Territory, and with it a circular Letter to all the
  Parish-Priests, Captains and Commissaries of the Quarters,
  for their more ample Instruction.</p>
<p>The 28<sup>th</sup> two other Vessels laden with the rest of the
  Bread-Corn given by his Holiness, arrive at Toulon:
  The Bishop comes to the Town-house, to concert with
  M. de Langeron and the Sheriffs, the Means of getting
  it brought to this City, whither those Vessels will not
  come because of the Contagion.</p>
<p>The 29<sup>th</sup>, the Difficulty made by the Masters of Vessels
  of Languedoc, to come laden with Provisions to the
  Port of Frioul in the Island of Roteneau, one of the
  Isles of Marseilles, whither the Barrier is removed from Lestaque, because after they have unladen at that Island,
  no Ballast is to be had there, without which they cannot
  sail empty, and return to their own Ports; this
  Difficulty, I say, obliges M. de Langeron and the Sheriffs
  to send for the Regulators of the Fishermen to the
  Town-house, and order them to see that no Boat goes
  out to fish, till it has first carried a lading of Ballast
  to that Isle of Roteneau.</p>
<p>The 30<sup>th</sup> the Chevalier Rose undertakes for the Execution
  of this Order; and he succeeds so well in it,
  that all the Ballast necessary for all the Vessels which
  may come to that Island, is presently carried thither.</p>
<p>The First of December the Hospital of the Rive-Neuve,
  governed and directed by the Chevalier Rose, being become
  useless, the few Sick remaining in it are removed
  to that of la Charit�, and the other is entirely shut up:
  M. Boyer de Paradis, one of the Physicians who came
  from Paris by Order of his Royal Highness, served in
  it with all the Ardour and Zeal, that the Love of his native
  Country could inspire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>From the second to the fifth, Assemblies are held, to
  settle all the Dispositions and all the Measures necessary
  for purifying and dis-infecting all the Houses of the City
  in which the Contagion has been: A tedious Work,
  which to be very minutely performed, must be as laborious
  as it is nice and important.</p>
<p>The 6<sup>th</sup>, the grand Infirmaries having been for some
  time purified, M. Michel, a Physician of the Faculty of Marseilles, who had been shut up in them from the
  beginning of the Contagion, comes out with the
  Surgeons he had with him; he served with a Zeal,
  Firmness, and Success, which make him admired by
  all.</p>
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup>, the Intendants of Health assemble at the
  Town-house, in the Presence of M. de Langeron and
  the Sheriffs, to deliberate about purifying all the Vessels
  that are in the Port, who had taken in their Cargoes
  before the Plague broke out; these Intendants (those
  of them who had absented being come back long since)
  do their Duty so well, that tho' they are obliged to serve
  only by Turns, they generally all act together, hardly
  any one excusing himself.</p>
<p>The Directors of the Hospital-general of la Charit� and those of the H�tel Dieu, acquit themselves also of their
  Duty with the same Ardour: The latter even took upon
  them the Direction of this Hospital when it was turned
  into a Pest-House, tho' the coming near such a Place
  gives Disgust and makes one tremble: The Zeal among
  them was so extraordinary, that at the beginning
  of the Contagion, when every Body was running away,
  M. Bruno Grainier was seen to quit his own House,
  and take up his Lodgings in the H�tel Dieu, there to devote
  himself intirely to the Service of the Poor, and
  endeavour to prevent the Plague's getting into it; accordingly
  it never could get in, before it had overthrown
  this pious Argus, and deprived of Life this Example
  of the most fervent and active Charity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>Almost all the Municipal Officers, and other Principal
  Citizens have been come back also some time;
  most of the Shops of Tradesmen and Artificers are
  opened; the People, who in their Fright had lost all
  Hope of Health, and all Measure of Prudence, are
  brought to themselves, and put into Heart again
  by the Presence and good Orders of M. de Langeron;
  and every one is at present assisting each other by mutual
  Offices, and by an exact and admirable Administration
  of Government; which cutting off all destructive
  Communication, allows only what is salutary. As
  this is but a brief Journal, drawn up in haste in some
  Moments stolen from Business, the Publick may expect
  an ample Supplement to it, which shall take in
  several Things here omitted, and the Services worthy
  of Notice and Acknowledgment, which several Persons
  have rendred to the City, as well within it, as Abroad;
  and the Wonders performed by the Surgeons,
  whom the Court was pleased to send, and others, shall
  not be forgotten.</p>
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup>, the Danger of Communication hindring still
  the Opening of the Churches, the Bishop orders Altars
  to be set up in the Streets, and Mass to be said at them
  in Publick.</p>
<p>This Day M. de Langeron, the Marquess de Pilles,
  and the Sheriffs, publish an Ordinance, directing the
  Commissaries of the Quarters and Parishes, all they are
  to do generally, as well for hindring whatever might
  contribute to the keeping of the Contagion in the
  Town, or increasing it by introducing the Distemper
  from Abroad, as for concurring to the great Work still
  remaining, of disinfecting all the Houses.</p>
<p>The 9<sup>th</sup>, upon Notice that several Taverns, Victualing-Houses,
  Coffee-Houses, and other like Houses of
  Publick Resort are opened, where People meeting in
  Crowds, a mortal Communication is to be feared; an
  Ordinance is published, at my Instance, for their being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> all shut up again, on the Penalty of Imprisonment, and
  of a Fine of thirty Livres.</p>
<p>This present Day (the 10<sup>th</sup> of December) the Distemper
  has so abated throughout the City, that no new Patient
  has been carried into any Hospital: There is
  Ground to hope, that the Wrath of God will be intirely
  appeased; that this miserable unfortunate City will
  be wholly delivered from this cruel Visitation, which
  has laid it desolate; and that we shall be secured from
  all Returns of it, by the wise, exact, and judicious
  Precautions which M. de Langeron takes, in Concert
  with the Sheriffs, with such indefatigable Zeal, such
  laborious Assiduity, such prudent Vigilance, and such
  singular Application, that the Preservation of Marseilles cannot but be looked upon as his Work; and its surviving
  Inhabitants will be ever obliged to bless his glorious
  Name, and those of the Sheriffs, who second him
  so well, and do so justly merit, by the Ardour with
  which they have exposed their Lives, the Title of <span class="smcap">Fathers of their Country</span>.</p>
