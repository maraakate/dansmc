<P>Someone asked, through the comments page, for my Testimony so <a href="testimony.htm">HERE</A> it is!

<P>Robert Cecil, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (1830-1903) said. "No lesson seems to be so deeply inculcated by the experience of life as that you should never trust experts, If you believe doctors, nothing is wholesome: if you believe the theologians, nothing is innocent: if you believe the soldiers, nothing is safe."

<P>Let's think about this for a second. Our current health care system is so proud of extending our lives, but have they really? The Bible tells in Psalms 90:10 <B>"The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
us."</B>

<P>SO seventy or eighty years. Which is about what we have right now. Take a look at your obituary pages in the local newspaper. Yes, some people live into their nineties and even more. Well, so did Abraham, but for the most part seventy or eighty is it. Now consider this. If you have a group of people and half of them die at age one and the other half die at age 100 then the average age of at death is about 50.  It seems that the medicos extending our life span is really just medicos removing or nullifying the causes of EARLY death. 

<P>Medical science is very good at curing acute problems. Problems that arise suddenly like you fall on your head and the doctors operate to stop the brain from swelling. Chronic or long lasting problems, say cancer, are much harder to cure and they can cost a lot to cure. Did I say cure? Let's just say you survive. You may survive five years, ten years, twenty years or more..., or not. All this surviving costs a lot of money. The big question is are you willing to pay that money. 

In a way, it's like going fast on your motorcycle. You got 20Hp you can probably go 80MPH. To go 100 you need 40Hp. To go 120, you need 60-80Hp. 140, 110Hp. 180, maybe 150Hp. 200? A lot more then that! 

<P>The point is, the Horse power has to go up a lot faster then the speed. At some point the gain simply is not worth it. You want fancy cancer drugs that get you just a few months more of life you have to pay a LOT more money. Somebody HAS to pay the extra money.

<P>My father paid into the different insurance companies all his life. When he reached 65 they all shuffled him off to Medicare. He had heart problems. Sometimes I would take him to the Doctor and I noticed two things. One, there were about six office personal to every Doctor. They handled all the insurance stuff. Two, they had to take care of everyone. Even the Bums that did not have health insurance. We are told that is being "Compassionate" but I can't help but think my Father should have gotten better care and the Bums less care. The Bums made the choice to have a bottle of booze and NOT have health care. Other people choose a fancy car or a better vacation instead of health care. 

<P>If you CHOOSE to not have health care, shouldn't you have the freedom to do so? I'll let you decide.

I hope you have a HAPPY NEW YEAR!

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!

<P>One last thing. This is for comments on my Blobs only. No motorcycle questions because I'm not writing back from this E-Mail address. OK? 

<P>If you have motorcycle questions click the motorcycle <a href="emailtome.htm"><img src="cr125r.gif" width=50 height=30 border=0></A> and follow my rules.
