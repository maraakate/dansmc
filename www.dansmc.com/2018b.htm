<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</b></font><font size=4> In the past year I have learned a thing that absolutely amazes me. That thing is how much the Rinos and Dinos truly hate America. Talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_off_the_nose_to_spite_the_face" target="_blank">cutting your nose off to spite your face.</A> Both Republican and Democratic Deep state politicians are all about keeping themselves in power and NOT about serving the people. However, they will accept awards, honors and a great retirement pension for their "Service", from the people they are supposed to be serving. 

<P> Silly me. I thought our leaders were working for the USA, but no. They are working for the betterment of the world. To these "know it alls" the people of the USA are the rich 1% ers who need to be taken down a notch with their money taxed and given to the worlds poor. These people do not make anything but they take credit for everything. Remember President Oboma's quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKjPI6no5ng" target="_blank">"You didn't build that."</a> ? Well, he was wrong. You did build that and a lot of other stuff too. All these Rinos and Dinos think they can steal your earnings and give it to someone who took no risks. Ask yourself. Will you risk your own money and time, work hard and long hours only to give it all to someone who sleeps in and goofs off playing video games all day? If you are, please E-mail me 'cause I really need a new motorcycle. Capitalism, not socialism produces the high standard of living we here in the USA enjoy. I notice immigrants are NOT trying to get into Venezuela.

<P> A good current example of this is our current argument on immigration. Instead of staying in their own country and making it a better place (you know, like we did.)  these worthless people seem to think they can come to our country illegally, cut in line, and steal my citizenship and the benefits we give our LEGAL citizens. If I complain about that and vote for President Trump, Donny Deutsch and others say "This can no longer be about who Trump is, it has to be about who we are," Deutsch, added that "we can no longer say Trump's the bad guy. If you vote for Trump, you're the bad guy. If you vote for Trump, you are ripping children from parents' arms." 

<P> I won't  bother to mention that it seems some 80 % of these children are not related to their illegal boarder crossing "parents". Unless, of course, you count sex traffickers and drug smugglers as parents. They do it cheap too. $10,000 to send a kid to the USA instead of $100,000 to get them to adulthood at home in South America. What a deal! Plus, some of them might even make it too. I'm sure all those "Good Parents" down south are OK with the risks.

<P> How can we have any political discourse if our opponents say we are totally evil? Liberals, are you not doing what the Fascists and Communists and Nazis did? So much hate and so many lies. Sharyl Attkisson wrote about fifty of these lies <a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/06/19/50-media-mistakes-in-the-trump-era-the-definitive-list/" target="_blank">HERE.</A> Bill Maher wants our economy to crash so it hurts President Trump. What a dope. Again, Talk about cutting your nose (and ears) off to spite your face.

<P>The idiocy on the far left is stunning. Transgendered track stars Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood won their races. I guess no real, biological girls need apply. No way you could win. Wow, just think of the possibilities for High School males now. Let's get a hold of our feminine side. Let's go shower with the girls. But wait. Isn't that cultural appropriation? Or is that Mansplaining?

<P>The Apostle Paul wrote in Romans 1:22-32 

<P><B>"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."</B>

<P>This is what is happening today. Paul continues:

<P><B> "For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."</B>

<P>Also consider this.

<P><B>"Knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts"</B> 2nd Peter 3:3

<P>Are we in the last days? I think we might be. But maybe not. Maybe the efforts of President Trump to pull us back from the edge of ruin might be enough. Or not. Remember what the Bible tells us in 2nd Peter 3:8-10

<P><B> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</B>

<P>No matter how bad it looks we can take comfort in the fact that Jesus is covering our backs.

<P><B> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</B>

<center>President Trump will not save us, <BR>nether will the Rinos or Dinos. 

<p>Only believing on and trusting in <BR><B><font size=5>Jesus Christ</font></B><BR> will save us.

<P>Nothing else will do. Are you saved? Think about it.</center>

<center><h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS TO ME<BR></H1></center>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
