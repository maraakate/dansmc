JOB 12:1 And Job answered and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?<br>
<br>
JOB 12:4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:<br>
<br>
JOB 12:8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?<br>
<br>
JOB 12:10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?<br>
<br>
JOB 12:12 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.<br>
<br>
JOB 12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.<br>
