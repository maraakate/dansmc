SONG 8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?<br>
<br>
SONG 8:9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.<br>
<br>
SONG 8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.<br>
<br>
