<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
AMOS 5:1 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:3 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:5 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:6 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:16 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:18 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:20 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:21 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:26 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.<br>
<br>
AMOS 5:27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.<br>
<br>
