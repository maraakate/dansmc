<br>
GEN 36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;<br>
<br>
GEN 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;<br>
<br>
GEN 36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.<br>

<br>
GEN 36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.<br>
<br>
GEN 36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.<br>
