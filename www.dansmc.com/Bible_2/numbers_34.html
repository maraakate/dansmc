NUM 34:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
<br>
NUM 34:2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)<br>
<br>
NUM 34:3 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:6 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:7 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:8 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:<br>
<br>
NUM 34:12 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.<br>
<br>

<br>
NUM 34:18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:19 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.<br>

<br>
NUM 34:24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.<br>
<br>
NUM 34:26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.<br>
