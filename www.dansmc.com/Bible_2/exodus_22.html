<br>
EX 22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.<br>
<br>
EX 22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.<br>

<br>
EX 22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;<br>
<br>
EX 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.<br>
<br>
EX 22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.<br>
<br>
EX 22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:<br>
<br>
EX 22:27 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.<br>
<br>
EX 22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.<br>
<br>
EX 22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.<br>
<br>
EX 22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.<br>
<br>
EX 22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.<br>
