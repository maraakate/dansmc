SONG 1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?<br>
<br>
SONG 1:8 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:15 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:16 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.<br>
<br>
SONG 1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.<br>
