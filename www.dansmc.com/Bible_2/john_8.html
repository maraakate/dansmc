JN 8:1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
JN 8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<br>
<br>
JN 8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,<br>
<br>
JN 8:4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.<br>
<br>
JN 8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?<br>
<br>
JN 8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.<br>
<br>
JN 8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.<br>
<br>
JN 8:8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<br>
<br>
JN 8:9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<br>
<br>
JN 8:10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<br>
<br>
JN 8:11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<br>
<br>
JN 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br>
<br>
JN 8:13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.<br>
<br>
JN 8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.<br>
<br>
JN 8:15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.<br>
<br>
JN 8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<br>
<br>
JN 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.<br>
<br>
JN 8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.<br>
<br>
JN 8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.<br>
<br>
JN 8:20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.<br>
<br>
JN 8:21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.<br>
<br>
JN 8:22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<br>
<br>
JN 8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<br>
<br>
JN 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<br>
<br>
JN 8:25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.<br>
<br>
JN 8:26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<br>
<br>
JN 8:27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<br>
<br>
JN 8:28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<br>
<br>
JN 8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<br>
<br>
JN 8:30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.<br>
<br>
JN 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br>
<br>
JN 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br>
<br>
JN 8:33 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<br>
<br>
JN 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.<br>
<br>
JN 8:35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.<br>
<br>
JN 8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br>
<br>
JN 8:37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.<br>
<br>
JN 8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.<br>
<br>
JN 8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.<br>
<br>
JN 8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.<br>
<br>
JN 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.<br>
<br>
JN 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<br>
<br>
JN 8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.<br>
<br>
JN 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br>
<br>
JN 8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<br>
<br>
JN 8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?<br>
<br>
JN 8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.<br>
<br>
JN 8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?<br>
<br>
JN 8:49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.<br>
<br>
JN 8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<br>
<br>
JN 8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<br>
<br>
JN 8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<br>
<br>
JN 8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<br>
<br>
JN 8:54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:<br>
<br>
JN 8:55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.<br>
<br>
JN 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.<br>
<br>
JN 8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<br>
<br>
JN 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.<br>
<br>
JN 8:59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<br>
