<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
PHILEM 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:12 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.<br>
<br>
PHILEM 1:25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<br>
<br>
</B>
