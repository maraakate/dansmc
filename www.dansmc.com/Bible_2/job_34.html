JOB 34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 34:2 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?<br>
<br>
JOB 34:8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?<br>
<br>
JOB 34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;<br>
<br>
JOB 34:15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?<br>
<br>
JOB 34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?<br>
<br>
JOB 34:19 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;<br>
<br>
JOB 34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:<br>
<br>
JOB 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:<br>
<br>
JOB 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:<br>
<br>
JOB 34:32 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.<br>
<br>
JOB 34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.<br>
<br>
