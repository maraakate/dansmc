PROV 24:1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:5 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:9 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;<br>
<br>
PROV 24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?<br>
<br>
PROV 24:13 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:16 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?<br>
<br>
PROV 24:23 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;<br>
<br>
PROV 24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.<br>
<br>
PROV 24:33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br>
<br>
PROV 24:34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.<br>
