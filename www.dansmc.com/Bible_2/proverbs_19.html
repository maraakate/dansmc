<br>
PROV 19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.<br>

<br>
PROV 19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.<br>
<br>
PROV 19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.<br>
