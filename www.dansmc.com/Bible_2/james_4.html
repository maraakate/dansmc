<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
JAS 4:1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?<br>
<br>
JAS 4:2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?<br>
<br>
JAS 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br>
<br>
JAS 4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:<br>
<br>
JAS 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.<br>
<br>
JAS 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.<br>
<br>
