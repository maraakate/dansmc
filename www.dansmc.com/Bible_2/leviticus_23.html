<br>
LEV 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.<br>
<br>

<br>
LEV 23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savor: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:<br>
<br>
LEV 23:16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.<br>

<br>
LEV 23:28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
<br>

<br>
LEV 23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>

<br>
LEV 23:37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:<br>
<br>
LEV 23:38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:<br>
<br>
LEV 23:43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.<br>
<br>
LEV 23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.<br>
