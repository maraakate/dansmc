<br>
PROV 16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:7 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br>

PROV 16:15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!<br>
<br>
PROV 16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.<br>
<br>
PROV 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.<br>
