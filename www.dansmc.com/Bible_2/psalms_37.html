<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
PS 37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<br>
<br>
PS 37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.<br>
<br>
PS 37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br>
<br>
PS 37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
<br>
PS 37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
<br>
PS 37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.<br>
<br>
PS 37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br>
<br>
PS 37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.<br>
<br>
PS 37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<br>
<br>
PS 37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<br>
<br>
PS 37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
<br>
PS 37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br>
<br>
PS 37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<br>
<br>
PS 37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.<br>
<br>
PS 37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br>
<br>
PS 37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
<br>
PS 37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br>
<br>
PS 37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
<br>
PS 37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
<br>
PS 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br>
<br>
PS 37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.<br>
<br>
PS 37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<br>
<br>
PS 37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
<br>
PS 37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
<br>
PS 37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<br>
<br>
PS 37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<br>
<br>
PS 37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br>
<br>
PS 37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<br>
PS 37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br>
<br>
PS 37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.<br>
<br>
PS 37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.<br>
<br>
PS 37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br>
<br>
PS 37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
<br>
PS 37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<br>
<br>
PS 37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.<br>
<br>
PS 37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
<br>
PS 37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.<br>
<br>
PS 37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<br>
PS 37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.<br>
<br>
PS 37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<br>
