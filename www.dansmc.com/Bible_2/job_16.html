JOB 16:1 Then Job answered and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 16:2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?<br>
<br>
JOB 16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?<br>
<br>
JOB 16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;<br>
<br>
JOB 16:17 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.<br>
<br>
JOB 16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!<br>
<br>
JOB 16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.<br>
<br>
</B>
