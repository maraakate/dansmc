<br>
DEUT 33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.<br>

<br>
DEUT 33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.<br>

DEUT 33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.<br>
<br>

<br>
DEUT 33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.<br>
<br>

<br>
DEUT 33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.<br>
<br>
DEUT 33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.<br>
