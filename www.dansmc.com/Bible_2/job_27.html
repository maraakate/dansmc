JOB 27:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 27:2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;<br>
<br>
JOB 27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;<br>
<br>
JOB 27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?<br>
<br>
JOB 27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?<br>
<br>
JOB 27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?<br>
<br>
JOB 27:11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?<br>
<br>
JOB 27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;<br>
<br>
JOB 27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.<br>
<br>
JOB 27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.<br>
<br>
</B>
