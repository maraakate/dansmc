JOB 33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,<br>
<br>
JOB 33:9 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,<br>
<br>
JOB 33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;<br>
<br>
JOB 33:16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,<br>
<br>
JOB 33:17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:<br>
<br>
JOB 33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:<br>
<br>
JOB 33:24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:<br>
<br>
JOB 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;<br>
<br>
JOB 33:28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,<br>
<br>
JOB 33:30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.<br>
