<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
GEN 49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?<br>
<br>
GEN 49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)<br>
<br>
GEN 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:<br>
<br>
GEN 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:27 Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<br>
<br>
GEN 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.<br>
<br>
GEN 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.<br>
