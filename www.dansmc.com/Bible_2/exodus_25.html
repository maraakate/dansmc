<br>
EX 25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.<br>
<br>
EX 25:3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,<br>
<br>
EX 25:4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,<br>
<br>
EX 25:5 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,<br>
<br>

<br>
EX 25:15 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.<br>
<br>
EX 25:16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.<br>
<br>
EX 25:17 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.<br>
<br>
EX 25:18 And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.<br>

<br>
EX 25:22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<br>
<br>

<br>
EX 25:24 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.<br>

<br>

<br>
EX 25:27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.<br>
<br>

<br>
EX 25:31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.<br>
<br>
EX 25:32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:<br>
<br>
EX 25:33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.<br>
<br>

<br>
EX 25:35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.<br>
<br>
EX 25:36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.<br>
<br>
EX 25:37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.<br>
<br>
EX 25:38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.<br>
<br>
EX 25:39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.<br>
<br>
EX 25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.<br>
