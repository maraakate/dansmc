<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
LAM 3:1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:2 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:5 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:6 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:14 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:<br>
<br>
LAM 3:19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:22 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:<br>
<br>
LAM 3:32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,<br>
<br>
LAM 3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<br>
<br>
LAM 3:38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?<br>
<br>
LAM 3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?<br>
<br>
LAM 3:40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;<br>
<br>
LAM 3:62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.<br>
<br>
LAM 3:66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.<br>
<br>
