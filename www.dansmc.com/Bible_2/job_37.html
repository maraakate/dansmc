<br>
JOB 37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:<br>
<br>
JOB 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.<br>
