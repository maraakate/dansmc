<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
DEUT 10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.<br>
<br>
DEUT 10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.<br>
