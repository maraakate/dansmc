<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Tahoma" size= "3">
HOS 11:1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:2 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:5 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:6 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:7 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:10 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:11 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.<br>
<br>
HOS 11:12 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.<br>
<br>
