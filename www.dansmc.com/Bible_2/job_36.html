JOB 36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;<br>
<br>
JOB 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?<br>
<br>
JOB 36:23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?<br>
<br>
JOB 36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:<br>
<br>
JOB 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?<br>
<br>
JOB 36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.<br>
<br>
JOB 36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.<br>
