JOB 28:1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:<br>
<br>
JOB 28:8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?<br>
<br>
JOB 28:13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?<br>
<br>
JOB 28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;<br>
<br>
JOB 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:<br>
<br>
JOB 28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.<br>
<br>
JOB 28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.<br>
