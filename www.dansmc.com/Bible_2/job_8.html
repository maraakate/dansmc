JOB 8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?<br>
<br>
JOB 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?<br>
<br>
JOB 8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;<br>
<br>
JOB 8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;<br>
<br>
JOB 8:6 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:<br>
<br>
JOB 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)<br>
<br>
JOB 8:10 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?<br>
<br>
JOB 8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?<br>
<br>
JOB 8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:<br>
<br>
JOB 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:<br>
<br>
JOB 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.<br>
<br>
JOB 8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.<br>
<br>
