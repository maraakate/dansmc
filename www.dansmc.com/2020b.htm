<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> We interrupt this Election Season with Real Life. The Chinese Wuhan Virus has come to our Nation. Let us listen to Real Experts, working on the front lines, like Dr. David Price. I follow his advice. You should too. <a href='2020b.htm#label'>Go to the Doctor's recommendations.</A>
<BR><BR><BR>

<center><font size=7><B>September 12th 2020 </B></font></center><BR>

<P>Well, here we go again. The silly season is in full swing. One e-mail I got accused President Trump of instituting socialisum because he got rid of Obama's pandemic responce protocols. Huh? Nothing Obama did was worth much. You will remember Obama and Biden did not replenish our mask and respirator supplies. I remember Biden also said President Trump acted too soon on canceling flights from China. Like I said, it's the silly season.

<P>Another E-mail strongly supports Black Lives Matter organization. Sorry my friend, I believe ALL lives matter. While we are on this subject you might want to notice that there is NO systemic racism in this country. Perhaps millionaires like Ophra and Michelle and Whoopie see racism, but I do not. I think the real problem is that it really sucks to be equal. Just like adulthood is a real eye opener for kids out of collage. What? I have to pay for my own cellphone and electricity and gasoline and car repairs and everything else? No more participation Trophies and rewards? Same with equality, no more freebies. You have to earn it all on your own. I have often thought how great it would be if my father would walk in the door and tell me to go to bed at 8 and pay all my bills! Alas, my father died in 1999 and I am stuck in adulthood. Bummer!

<P>The e-mail continues stating "The vast majority of BLM supporters are simply people who believe their communities are threatened by police violence, or those like myself who are allied to their cause." Sorry friend, what I see is rioters burning down building and looting their contents are criminals carrying BLM signs. Let's see, we are at or over, 100 days of riots in Portland. Like Joe Biden said, "Come on Man" Those are NOT peacful protesters. Seems to me "Black Lives Matter" is the modern day equivalent of the "Klu Klux Clan" only they are putting down whites instead of blacks. Yeah, I know. The truth hurts.

<P>Now all these riots started over one man being killed by the police. No one seems to remember he was passing a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/counterfeit-20-bill-now-part-of-george-floyd-murder-case/" target="_blank">counterfit $20 bill</A>. We now fnd out that this man was blown out of his mind on the drug fentanyl. Apparently he had taken a very large, <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2020/09/02/new-evidence-in-the-george-floyd-case-that-could-change-everything-n2575428?utm_source=thdailypm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=09/02/2020&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">fatal dose of Fentanyl.</A> Maybe we need to put all these hundereds of supposed killings of Black Men in <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/larryelder/2020/09/03/pro-athletes-use-facts-stats-and-data-for-their-jobs--but-ignore-facts-stats-and-data-when-denouncing-systemic-police-brutality-n2575555?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=09/03/2020&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">perspective.</A>

<P>"Matt Walsh at The Daily Wire did the additional work of looking up the circumstances of each of these deaths, and he found the cops' track record to be even more clear-cut, more compelling in terms of its judiciousness.

<P>"According to the DOJ," writes Walsh, "police make about 10 million arrests each year. As a rough average, 7 million of the arrested suspects are white and 3 million are black. Out of that number, last year, 25 unarmed white people were killed by police, compared to 14 unarmed black people, according to the Washington Post database of police shootings. That means about .0004 percent of all blacks arrested were killed while unarmed. The percentage for whites is comparable. In total, 1,000 people were shot and killed by police in 2019, the vast majority of whom were armed." In any case, those 1,000 shootings amount to just 0.01% or one-ten-thousandth of all arrests made."

<P>All those hunereds of Black Men killed, were killed by other Black Men. See <a href="https://patriotpost.us/articles/72453-about-those-unarmed-black-men-killed-by-cops-dot-dot-dot-2020-07-28?mailing_id=5221&utm_medium=email&utm_source=pp.email.5221&utm_campaign=digest&utm_content=body" target="_blank">Blacks killed by Blacks</A>

<P>I will just say it. The United States is the freest, least racist, country in the world. Our Police and Justice System are the best in the world too. If you don't believe that go watch the TV show "Locked up Abroad". Given a choice, everyone wants to come to the USA. Can we do better? Sure we can but don't tell me to defund the Police. If you believe that you need to pull your head out of your <a href="fourth_point.htm" target="_blank">4th Point of Contact.</A> The lack of oxygen is making you loony.

<P>Here are two more interesting thoughts to consider. 

<P>One, whenever the Police shoot someone wait a day or two to get the facts. In 99.99% of the cases the person shot, white, black or whatever, was 

<UL>
<P>
<LI> 1) Doing something illegal. 
<P>
<LI> 2) High on some kind of drug. 
<P>
<LI> 3) Disobeying a clear command from the Police Officer.
</UL>
<P>Two, no one has a workable replacement plan for the Police. Come on Man, more soical workers is <B>NOT</B> a plan. The Current Police Plan works great. Can we improve it? Sure, but defunding Police is LOONY. Just look at the destuction in Portland. Just look at Chicago. Just look at New York City. Just look at... I can go on and on.

<P>There is something elso... all these burning cities... they are all have Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> Governors and Mayors. You are right, all this rioting is really getting out of control.

I'm reading through the book of Isaiah, verses 49:25-51:8 to be precise, right now and these verses seemed to go with what is happening today.

<P><I><B>"But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
<P> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

<P>My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
 
<P>Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation."</I></B>

<P>Wow, "feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;" "they shall be drunken with their own blood". Just think, the rioters have attacked the homes of the Mayors of Portland and Chicago. Eat their own, huh?

<P>The Salvation Isaiah is talking about is from and thru Jesus Christ. 

<P>This election is pretty straight forward. On one side we have 

Biden and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-father-condemns-jamaica-marijuana-joke-2019-2" target="_blank">Harris</A> who are:
<OL> 
<LI>Pro <a href="http://dansmc.com/abortion.htm" target="_blank">baby killing</A>. Say what you want, abortion kills the baby. Plus there is absolutly <B>NO</B> reason for any 3rd trimester abortions. 

<P>
<LI>Socialism. If you want that, you should LOVE Venezuela. Do you?

<P>
<LI>Anti God. Took "Under God" out of US Pledge of Allegiance. Some may disagree but the Pledges I heard during the DNC convention left out God.

<P>
<LI>Defunding Police. No Law and No Order. Pro Criminal. No Bail and let Criminals out of jail. It Rhymes... what could possibly go wrong?

<P>
<LI>Anti Gas, Coal and Oil. Really? Come on man, be realistic here. The only way that will work is if we cut back to Horse and Buggy speeds. Forget running the air conditioner on hot days... ask the Californians how they like it.

<P>
<LI> Over tax everyone and everything.

<P>
<LI> Unlimitated emigration. They are stealing your citizenship with this one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan%27s_Run_(film)" target="_blank"><img src="Logans_run.jpg" width=115 height=175 align=right></A>

<P>

<LI> Single Payer Health Care for everyone. Except for, of course, government leaders. Can you say "Death Pannels"? If they will kill babies, they will kill you as soon as you start costing them money. 

<P>Hey, it will be fun. Do it for the children, they'll say. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan%27s_Run_(film)" target="_blank">Logan's Run</A> The Perfect World of Total Pleasure. Socialism here we come!

<P>
<LI>Pro Global Cooling, Oh, wait, that was going to kill us in ten years back in 1970 or so the Experts said. Now it is global warming or so the UN said back in 2000. But wait, now it is climate change and like always, we only have <a href="https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions" target="_blank">Ten Years</A> to give them all our money so we can live. Don't worry, the money will be spent on <a href="https://issuesinsights.com/2020/08/24/that-dirty-green-energy/" target="_blank">good clean energy.</A> Can you say <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/remember-solyndra-loss-of-taxpayer-millions-seems-forgotten-expert-says" target="_blank">Solyndra?</A>

<P>
<LI>Don't worry about those nasty guns either, Beto will take them all away. You don't need them. The Democ<font size=5><B>rats</B></font> will protect and save us. Just like they've done in Portland and Chicago and New York City.
<P> Or will they???

<P>I say Socialism here we come. Can you say Venezuela? How about Cambodia? Soviet Union?

<P>Fortunately, all the lies are coming from the progressive left who, right now, are controling the Democratic party. It should be easy to know what to do but some people are still wondering how to vote. I can understand this. Just about all the alphabet news media are lying to us. Like the lie that Police kill hundereds of Black Men. A total lie. Yet fake news says otherwise.

<P>Fake news says "Orange Man Bad". But the President is not bad. You may not like his mannerisms but he gets the job done. In reallity, I think that is why some people don't like him... he gets the job done and it makes a lot of people look bad and these people don't want to take <a href="https://patriotpost.us/opinion/73271?mailing_id=5294&utm_medium=email&utm_source=pp.email.5294&utm_campaign=digest&utm_content=body" target="_blank">responsibility</A> for a poor job. Some people don't like his direct, say it like it is, <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/waynegrudem/2020/08/08/letter-to-an-antitrump-christian-friend-n2573909?utm_source=thdailypm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=08/08/2020&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">personality</A> but I do. He says what he means and means what he says. With President Trump what you see is what you get, warts and all. With Biden, what you see is not what you get. He hides his warts. Instead we get 47 years of... nothing, unless you count all the plagiarism.

<P> So let us look at President Trumps Record:

<OL>
<LI> Take the Wuhan Virus for example. President Trump banned flight from China while Sleepy Joe Biden was still asleep at the switch. Pelose was in China town saying all was well. Don't tell me she didn't. I saw the interview with her. Talk about dumb. President Trump was right on top of everything. Do I need to go into Masks and shutdowns? I guess so. I'm 70 years old, my wife's health is in very poor condithion. I wear a mask and gloves. If you are 20, 30, 40, in good health, you do not need to. Young kids don't seem to get it at all. 

<P>The <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2020/08/30/heres-the-shockingly-small-number-of-people-who-died-from-just-the-coronavirus-n2575306" target="_blank"> Number</A> of people who are actually dying from the Wuhan virus is really <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2020/08/29/it-looks-like-a-lot-of-those-positive-covid-tests-should-have-been-negative-n2575305?utm_source=thdailypm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=08/30/2020&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">quite small.
</A>

<P>
<LI>President Trump has pushed continually for <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/yale-epidemiologist-says-hydroxychloroquine-key-defeating-covid-19" target="_blank">hydroxychloroquine</A> and this has saved many lives both Democrat and Republican.

<P>
<LI> President Trump is leading us OUT of the lock down. Lockdown was an <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/stanford-professor-lockdown-failures-we-quarantined-healthy-and-we?utm_source=daily-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter" target="_blank">Idea which did not work.<A> We need to take care of the Old and Sick and let everyone else get <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/dennisprager/2020/09/01/the-lockdown-has-gone-from-a-mistake-to-a-crime-n2575412?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=09/01/2020&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">back to work.</A>

<P>
<LI> The Economy. President is leading the nation out of the worst Panadmic in 100 years. The Chinese Wuhan Virus, thanks China. Thanks for nothing.

<P>
<LI>Pulling business and jobs back to our country. Obozo and Biden over taxed them and forced them out of our country. 

<P>
<LI> Peace in the Middle East. With the new deal between Israel, United Arab Emirates and now Bahrain, peace is  real possibility. This is a big deal. President Trump has gone further along the road to peace in the Middle East then all our past presidents put together.

<P>
<li> School Choice. What a great Idea. Black, Hispanic, White parents pick schools that are best for their own children.

<P>
<LI> Stop getting into useless wars. President Trump has done GREAT in this. How he handled North Korea and Iran was brilliant.

<P>
<LI> Tax Cuts. Tax cuts have boosted the economy and put money into my hands and yours too.

<P>
<li> President Trump Is for more funding for the Police and cutting funding to cities who defund the police. If you have had your business looted and burned down by "Peaceful Protesters" This could be important.

<P>
<LI> President Trump has cut way back on useless regulations.

<P>
<LI> President Trump has and will continue to get NATO member countries to pay their agreed share of NATO costs.

<P>
<LI> President Trump is building the wall on our Southern Boarder. It keeps out <B>ILLEGAL ALIENS</B> who steal our money and citizenship and bring in illegal drugs.

</OL>

<P>So it comes down to this. 

<OL>
<LI>A vote for Sleepy Joe is a vote for riots, high taxes, a bad economy, no law and order, no guns to protect yourself and the government telling you what to do. The Democ<font size=5><B>rats</B></font> hate America

<P>OR

<LI>A vote for President Trump means <B>FREEDOM</B>, Law and Order, and a GREAT Economy. The Republicans love America.
</OL>

<P>Seems like a no brainer to me.

<P>Again from Isaiah, Chapter 55.
<P>
 <I><B>"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
<P>
 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
<P>
 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
<P>
 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.
 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
<P> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
<P>
 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."</B></I>


<P>Remember What was told to the jailer in Acts 16:27-31 <I><B>"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
<P>
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</B></I>"

<P>Isaiah 10:1-2 tells us <B>"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!"</B>

<p>
<font size=5>&#182;</font><font size=4 face=tahoma> Wow, riots, riots everywhere. Police nowhere. 

<P> So we Protest over the death of a Black Man, George Floyd but ignore the death of another innocent <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/retired-police-captain-shot-to-death-at-st-louis-pawn-shop-in-slaying-caught-on/article_d482138c-0224-5393-bd87-9898bebb3fd1.html" target="_blank">Black Man, David Dorn</A>, Killed by looters.  Huh? Does not Mr. Dorn deserve a protest on his behalf?

<P>To Protest is American. To Riot, kill and steal is simply criminal. To want to defund the Police is dumb beyond belief. 



<P>I used to call the Democrats the "Loyal Opposition" but not anymore. Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> Governors and Mayors are destroying our cities. Minority business owners are the ones hurt most by the unconstitutional and treasonous policies of the Democ<font size=5><B>rats</B></font>. It is OK to Riot but not OK to go to Church? It's OK to Steal but not OK to get a hair cut? It is OK to Kill babes and other people but not OK to go work and make money? 



<P>Below is a good article.

<P><a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/ryanbomberger/2020/06/05/top-10-reasons-i-reject-the-blm-n2570105?utm_source=thdailypm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl_pm&newsletterad=&bcid=aa8a0175b47807676d6fbef51777ab63&recip=5509090" target="_blank">Top 10 Reasons I Won't Support the #BlackLivesMatter Movement"</A>

<P>Here is another thing to consider before we defund our Police. The Wall Street Journal reports that a Policeman is 18 times more likely to be killed by a Black Male then a Black male is to be killed by the Police. I know many people will question the numbers but it basically boils down to this. A lot more police are killed by Black Males then unarmed Black Males killed by Police. A lot more unarmed Whites are killed by Police then unarmed Blacks. A huge number of Black Males are killed by other Black Males. So exactly what and why is everyone protesting?

<P> The Old Testament Prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 3:4-6
<P><center><B>"And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
"</B></center>

<P>Well, Isaiah sure described our State Governors right. These State Governors, most all who are democRATs, are actually telling you it is illegal to go to church but not illegal to go to a liquor store. You can kill a baby but you can't get a hair cut or go to work. It would seem that the values of the democRATic party are garbage. How to live? Don't worry, <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/parable-sheep-goats.html" target="_blank">Goat Pelosi</A> will give you free money. Bread and Circuses are making a come back. Is this really happening in America? Didn't we have a Constitution? A Bill of Rights? Didn't the little State Princes (Governors) swear to uphold the US Constitution? Guess not, the way they are acting. Perhaps we need a 1776 moment to occur.


<P>Governor Cuomo issued an order forcing Nursing Homes to take in Wuhan Virus patients. Over 2000 elderly people in these Nursing homes died of the Wuhan Virus before he rescinded the order, and he wants to run for President. If you'd vote for this looser you will have <a href="Kool-aid.JPG" target="_blank">drunk the Kool-aid.</A>

<P>Sleepy Joe Biden is still in his basement saying, well, I'm not exactly sure what he is saying. Perhaps it was what he said in the past about China. You know China of Wuhan Virus fame. Biden said they are "Good folks". What a leader! If you'd vote for this confused, senile, old man you've had your head up your <a href="fourth_point.htm" target="_blank">Fourth Point of Contact</A> too long. The lack of oxygen is making you hallucinate.

<p>Speaking of China. We, the people of the USA, not to mention the people of the entire world, have lost Trillions of dollars and what looks to be several hundred thousand lives (in the USA alone) all caused by China's bungling. China stopped travel from Wuhan to the rest of China but NOT to the rest of the world. China caused this Pandemic. <a href="https://patriotpost.us/alexander/69656-cv19-made-in-china-send-xi-the-bill-2020-04-01?mailing_id=5063&utm_medium=email&utm_source=pp.email.5063&utm_campaign=digest&utm_content=body" target="_blank">China</A> must be made to pay restitution. How about we start with zeroing out our dept to China? How about bringing back ALL of our medicine manufacturing and everything else to the USA? How about a Thousand Percent tariff on all Chinese goods till they make good on their the debt to the USA and the world for the Wuhan Virus?

<P>Add another thing. Again in Democ<B>RAT</B> controlled cities. At least I don't know of any Republican lead cites doing this. They are letting criminals out of jail. What lunacy is this? 

<P>Remember Ecclesiastes 8:11

<BR><center><B>" Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, <BR> therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."</B></center>

<P>One thing about the Wuhan Virus epidemic, It allows us all to see and live, for a short while, how it would be to live under Socialism. Wow, no work, no jobs, free government money, just not very much of it. We can't go anywhere or do anything or buy anything unless it is government approved. 

<P>Just like Rome as it failed. Bread and Circuses. Just not much bread and a very poor circus. Think how great it will be once the money runs out. And it will run out. Check out Venezuela. Like Margaret Thatcher said "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples' money." And

<P>"Let us never forget this fundamental truth: the State has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves. If the State wishes to spend more it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. It is no good thinking that someone else will pay - that 'someone else' is you. There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money." ~ Margaret Thatcher

<P> Notice how all the government employees are still getting paid a full wage. Are <font size=5><B><U>YOU</U></B></font> still getting your full wage? No? I didn't think so. Do you think you will be able to get your I-Phone fixed when it breaks or wears out? Do you think you will have any money to pay to get a new one? Will there even be any new ones? The Socialism pushed by the Progressive Democ<B>RAT</B>s offers only lies and poverty.


<a href='2020b.htm#label1'>What are we to do?</A>

<P> Are you scared? If you do not know Jesus Christ and you are not trusting in him and him alone for your salvation you should be scared... very scared. I am telling you folks, <a href="time_is_near.htm" target="_blank">The Time is Near.</A> You need to listen to Jesus. Just saying... Now I've done my job, you have been warned.
<P>

<P> So you need to:
<OL><B>
<LI> Maintain six feet of distance to everyone. 
<P>
<LI> Use hand sanitizer and wash your hands a lot. 20 seconds or more, use lots of soap.
<P>
<LI> Don't touch your face or eyes or ears or nose or mouth. You get the Idea?
<P>
<LI> Wear a mask. This protects <font size=5 color=red>Others</font> from you. 
<P>
<LI> Wear gloves (I prefer 5mm Nitrile gloves) This protects <font size=5 color=red>You</font> from others.
</B></OL>

<P>Do those things and your chance of catching the Wuhan virus drops dramatically. You know, all this could help with the yearly Flu and other diseases. I particularly like the Social Distancing. Keeps all these creepy, irritating people at six feet away. What's not to like? Not to mention leaving no finger prints and no drones or cameras taking your picture, tracking who you are, and where you go. That could be handy if you happen to walk on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-americans-are-rebelling-against-neurotic-dumb-leaders-and-extreme-coronavirus-lockdowns" target="_blank">dry sand or want a haircut or play tennis</A>. Again, what's not to like? Nitrile gloves are reusable too. Wash your hands, a bit of hand sanitizer, pull them off and you are good to go to reuse them for the next trip to town.
<BR>

<P>Personally, I wear a mask and Nitrile gloves. I try to keep six foot of distance. I'm 70 years old. If others don't do this it is OK with me. It's called <B>FREEDOM</B> folks. Something Democ<B>RAT</B> Governors should try to remember.

<P> I saw an interview with another Doctor. He said that New York had (In April) about over 2300 Wuhan Virus deaths out of 10 million people but Japan had about 63 deaths with 124 million people. All the Japanese wear masks. Yet our health people say don't wear a mask. I think maybe we should wear masks. If you do not have one and can't get one, you can make one. Here are some <a href="facemaskinstructionsCOVID-19.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</A> to do just that! Here is a PDF on<a href="face_mask_2013.pdf" target="_blank"> Face Mask effectiveness.</A>

<P>
OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
