<P>So the President has no plan on much of anything except his own vacation. No budget. No foreign policy to speak of except bomb Libya... please explain to me again how this qualifies the President for the Nobel Peace Prize? 

<P>I ran across one quote from the Finance Editor for Townhall Finance, John Ransom on the stock market.

<P>"There is so much negative sentiment flowing, it's hard to break. Much of this stems from Presidential statements leading up to the budget resolution, but a lot of it comes from the evidence that the economy in the world pretty much stinks right now. A lot of that stems from the President too. 

<P>You can certainly blame some of this on Europe, but the lack of confidence at home keeps buyers in their foxholes. Capitalism has been under severe attack and eventually even the most hardened optimist gives up. I suspect buyers stay hidden until something gives them a real good reason to emerge. Every time they have come out, they have been slaughtered."

<P>Did you see the question the farmer asked President Obama? The President gave him the Royal run around, didn't he?

<P><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61720.html" target="_blank">Politico.com</a> reporters MJ Lee and Dan Berman tried to get a farm question answered. This is what happened.
<BR><HR><BR>

<P>Calling the USDA.

<P>"Thursday, 3:37 p.m.: I call the EPA's main number, where the operator connects me to someone else. When I explain that I would like to find out information about regulations concerning noise, dust and water runoff regulations and their possible effects on Illinois farmers, I am told that Illinois falls under "Region 5" and given their number.

<P>3:41 p.m.: At the regional office, I am transferred to somebody that deals with "clean air."

<P>"Have you gone through our website by any chance?" the person asks. "Our online information is very useful. Just in general practice, it's good."

<P>I said I was hoping to get some information over the phone and am given contact numbers for two people: one that handles "compliance enforcement" and someone else that works with "water compliance."

<P>I call both numbers and leave a message.

<P>3:50 p.m.: Then I call back the regional office, explaining that both people were not at their desks.

<P>"Normally Friday is not a good time - a lot of people don't work on Friday," the same person from earlier says. I mention that today is Thursday, to which they respond: "A lot of people take Friday off, but some people take Wednesday or Thursday off, too. And I know it's the end of the summer, but people grab the opportunity to take a vacation before school [starts]."

<P>The person gives me two more people's contact information: one who is an "environmental engineer" there, and another one who is at the "air and radiation division."

<P>Both of them are also not at their desks, and I leave messages.

<P>4:46 p.m.: I hear back from the "environmental engineer," who tells me I should speak to the person at the air and radiation division, with whom I left a message earlier.

<P>5:27 p.m.: The person from the air division calls back, who explains he wouldn't be the best person to talk to about water and noise regulations, and because noise regulations are not federally enforceable, the Illinois EPA would be the place to call.

<P>As for dust regulations, he says he would just need to know what kind of dust the farmer was talking about. "Without knowing what kind of source he's talking about, it'd be pretty hard to generalize what requirements there are," he says, adding that he would be happy to speak to the farmer from the town hall.

<P>5:38 p.m.: At the end of the day, I ask EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan for a comment on our experience with calling the EPA to follow up on USDA's response to Thursday's story. This was his response via email:

<P>"Below is an update on farm dust - while we do have statutory authority on noise pollution, I'm not aware of any pending rules or standards on that.

"Farm dust: This is a myth the Administrator has debunked personally on several occasions. While EPA is mandated by the CAA to review air quality standards for pollutants like farm dust every five years, and that review is currently ongoing, we have no plans to put stricter standards in place. That review, at Administrator's direction, has involved extensive outreach to farmers and ranchers."
<BR><HR>

<P>Now I totally understand and to be 100% truthful President Obama did not start it... he just made it worse. Back in 2006 I sold a bear rug to a man in Sweden. I took me Hours of time and many phone calls just to find out how to LEGALLY send it to him. The US Customs office in Washington DC told me to just send it and not do anything. That would be a good way to spend a few years in jail if I was caught. Thank you Uncle Sam! 
<BR><HR><BR>

<center><P>"Do not like this Uncle Sam, I do not like his health care scam.

<P>I do not like these dirty crooks, or how they lie and cook the books.

<P>I do not like when Congress steals, I do not like White House backdoor deals.

<P>I do not like when they kick the financial can, I do not like this 'YES, WE CAN!'

<P>I do not like their spending sprees. Why can't they get it -- nothing's free.

<P>I do not like their smug replies, broken promises and corruption ties.

<P>I do not like this kind of hope. I do not like it -- Nope nope nope!"

<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!

<P>One last thing. This is for comments on my Blobs only. No motorcycle questions because I'm not writing back from this E-Mail address. OK? 

<P>If you have motorcycle questions click the motorcycle <a href="emailtome.htm"><img src="cr125r.gif" width=50 height=30 border=0></A> and follow my rules.
