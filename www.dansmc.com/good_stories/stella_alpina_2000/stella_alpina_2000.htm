      <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Last year, with my parents having 
      volunteered to look after the kids, my wife Annie and I undertook our 
      first European tour in many years, once again taking in Mario Artusio’s 
      infamous Stella Alpina rally in Italy. &nbsp;Keen on a challenge and 
      fortunate to be invited, we also undertook the Stella Alpina "Safari" 
      organised over the following days for the more dedicated, insane or 
      masochistic, depending on your viewpoint. </P>
      <P align=justify>We limited our trip to a duration of just one week, 
      conscious of the fact that the kids may just drive the folks to regret 
      their decision! &nbsp;However, whilst our jaunt consisted of a somewhat 
      mad dash in both directions, we enjoyed a reasonably relaxed time down in 
      Italy, during which time we met old friends, made new acquaintances and 
      had a great time. </P>
      <P align=justify>Consequently, earlier this year, with a view to repeating 
      the exercise, I started dropping hints to both Annie and my parents. 
      &nbsp;The folks had no hesitation in volunteering their services again(!), 
      but to my surprise Annie decided to respect her long-term back problem and 
      declined the offer of another week away on the bike. &nbsp;However, noting 
      my disappointment, she offered me a one-week ‘pass’ to nip down to Italy 
      by myself. </P>
      <P align=justify>Whilst many would no doubt jump at such an offer, I did 
      try to talk her into doing the trip. &nbsp;I finally announced that with 
      limited time to prepare, a firm decision was required since the choice of 
      which motorcycle to take was dependent on whether the comfort of a pillion 
      passenger had to be considered. &nbsp;Little did I realise at the time, 
      but this statement would remain long remembered since it stunned her into 
      silence (a rare occurrence indeed!). </P>
      <P align=justify>The significance of the statement? &nbsp;Well the choice 
      of bikes in this case was between our ultra reliable and trusted, if a 
      little old, R80/7 or my 1972 Triumph 650 Tiger that had only been used on 
      fairly local runs since I fully re-built it some 12 years ago. </P>
      <P align=justify>Now personally, I like British motorcycles of this era, 
      and although Annie was clearly of the mind that reliability (or rather 
      lack of it) was an issue, my Tiger had never let me down and, unlike the 
      BeeEm, would return not less than 65 mpg. &nbsp;The only down side as far 
      as I was concerned would be the need for some chain maintenance given that 
      it was fitted with the old (non o-ring) Reynolds chain. </P>
      <P align=justify><U>The preparation</U> </P>
      <P align=justify>The decision was made. &nbsp;A 28-year-old Triumph was 
      the best machine for the job! &nbsp;Well of course it wasn’t really - you 
      only have to see the number of riders who ‘do’ the Stella on BMW twins! 
      </P>
      <P align=justify>Preparation (Servicing) - Change engine oil, clean gauze 
      oil filters, change gearbox oil, replace contact breakers and spark plugs, 
      valve clearances checked, new Avons back and front, new control cables 
      throughout, new fuel and oil lines, check primary chain and clutch 
      adjustment, carb stripped and cleaned, final drive chain removed, cleaned 
      and dipped in Duckhams Chain Guard (remember that stuff!), and finally 
      clean and polish. &nbsp;Ah yes, cleaning! &nbsp;Always the best way of 
      finding those little faults like the front mudguard that has just started 
      to split near one of the stays and the stay that has sheared just inside 
      the rubber mount on the fork leg. &nbsp;Never mind, I know a man with a 
      MIG welder who does what looks like a pretty good job and it hasn’t burned 
      off too much of the nice metallic blue paint finish. </P>
      <P align=justify>Preparation (Spares) - Control cables, spark plugs, 
      contact breakers, inner tubes, 2 litres of engine oil, numerous bottles of 
      Millers VSP fuel additive, test bulb, insulating tape, wire, rear drive 
      chain (two chains used in turn to prolong sprocket life), carb gaskets, 
      selection of nuts, bolts and screws, bulb set, spokes, and 5-minute epoxy 
      (an essential for BeeEm twin riders on the Stella for fixing holed sumps - 
      no joke!) </P>
      <P align=justify>Preparation (Tools) - A lot! </P>
      <P align=justify>Preparation (Luggage) - Not liking tank bags and deciding 
      that even one up, some serious luggage carrying capacity would be useful, 
      I turned my attention to fitting the classic Krauser panniers from the R80 
      using a set of the old die-cast aluminium Krauser fittings complete with 
      rear carrier. &nbsp;The design of the Triumph dictated that the panniers 
      could not be fitted wholly to the rear of the shock absorbers as on the 
      BeeEm and required new mountings to be produced throughout. &nbsp;Always 
      being one to err on the side of caution (or had you already noted that by 
      now!), I constructed the pannier mounts from 25mm x 5mm mild steel, which 
      used up the contents of two very large butane canisters to put the 
      required bends into the material. &nbsp;A coat of paint and some very 
      smart zinc-plated cap head screws later and the finished result looked 
      quite reasonable. </P>
      <P align=justify><U>The Holiday</U> </P>
      <P align=justify>Day 1 - Thursday, 6th July. </P>

      <P align=justify>Having caught an early morning Dover-Calais ferry, during 
      the crossing with good weather forecast and plenty of time to spare, I 
      decided that a little detour on roads not previously travelled would make 
      for a more interesting ride. &nbsp;Thus a lightning tour of Paris was 
      decided upon. </P>
      <P align=justify>One hour later, having taken the obligatory first 
      photograph of the holiday on the Calais dockside, I’m on the road, with 
      the sun quickly burning off the early morning mist and the Triumph running 
      as smoothly as a Triumph twin can. </P>
      <P align=justify>The miles pass uneventfully until Paris. &nbsp;Now I’m 
      used to riding in heavy traffic, but Paris, that really does have to be 
      seen to be believed. &nbsp;Eventually, I became so hot from alternately 
      riding at little more than a stand still and then getting caught for ages 
      at what seemed like every set of traffic lights, that the leather jacket 
      had to come off (not something I would generally recommend) and tucked 
      under the bungies with the tent. </P>
      <P align=justify>At last I found myself on the road just across the river 
      from Notre Dame and was just contemplating where to stop for a quick 
      photograph when the bike decided for me by running onto one cylinder. 
      &nbsp;Just as I pulled over, a helpful(?) passing motorcyclist informed me 
      that the bike was smoking from the RH exhaust. &nbsp;Knowing how hot the 
      motor must have been, thoughts of a holed piston entered my mind, quickly 
      followed by the disappointing prospect that for the first time ever, I may 
      have to cut short a holiday (indeed, nigh-on before it had really begun) 
      due to a mechanical breakdown. </P>
      <DIV 
      style="FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 420px; POSITION: relative; RIGHT: 10px; TOP: 6px; WIDTH: 297px">
      <P align=right><IMG border=0 height=400 
      src="stella2000-2-267x400.jpeg" 
      width=267></P></DIV>
      <P align=justify>Helmet off and bike up on the pavement, the problem was 
      soon identified. &nbsp;Not a holed piston but one HT lead with melted 
      through insulation where it laying across one of the rocker boxes and the 
      original champion plug cap melted over the spark plug. &nbsp;The HT lead 
      and plug cap on the other side weren’t in much healthier condition either. 
      </P>
      <P align=justify>Just as I was removing the luggage to gain access to the 
      tool kit, an English holidaymaker came over enquiring as to the problem. 
      &nbsp;Unfortunately, I really wasn’t in the mood for passing the time of 
      day at this point and following a brief conversation during which this 
      chap made mention of being a member of the BSA Owner’s Club, he departed. 
      &nbsp;Minutes later and he returned, presenting me with an ice-cold can of 
      drink before wishing me luck and continuing on his way. &nbsp;Not worth 
      noting you may think, but that gesture raised my spirits as much as if 
      someone had placed a new set of HT components in my hand. </P>
      <P align=justify>Several layers of insulating tape around the melted 
      components and a top up of engine oil later, I was back on the road but 
      stopping at regular intervals to take photographs whilst giving the engine 
      some brief cooling periods. &nbsp;South of the city and in a motorcycle 
      accessory shop I bought new (and very expensive!) silicon HT leads and NGK 
      plug caps; my lack of ability to ask for the parts in French being 
      overcome by saying "NGK" and drawing a sketch. </P>
      <P align=justify>Having by now lost a fair amount of time, I then pressed 
      on, riding through Fontainebleau and taking the more minor D905 route 
      towards Dijon. &nbsp;Riding until near last light, the tent provided my 
      overnight accommodation erected on a wide area of verge where I could 
      discreetly camp out of sight from the road. </P>
      <P align=justify>Day 2 - Friday, 7th July </P>
      <P align=justify>The camping kit was soon packed away for another early 
      start on the road. &nbsp;Unfortunately, rain having arrived overnight 
      necessitated the use of the wet weather gear - so much for my hope for 
      fine weather throughout. </P>
      <P align=justify>First fuel stop of the day was at Genlis, east of Dijon. 
      &nbsp;Having filled up, with the tank paintwork looking exceeding grubby 
      from a mixture of road dirt and fuel residue from the less than perfectly 
      sealing filler cap, I decided that a quick once over using the forecourt 
      windscreen washing facilities to be in order. </P>
      <P align=justify>However, on returning to the bike from paying for the 
      fuel, I was surprised to see water still dripping onto the ground. 
      &nbsp;Surprise then turned to alarm when I realised that the dripping 
      liquid was not water! </P>
      <P align=justify>Luggage off and tool kit out again, the fuel tank was 
      quickly removed to reveal a split along a weld on the underside of the 
      tank at the point where it provides for the fixing bolt to be passed 
      through. &nbsp;The offending area was quickly cleaned up and a layer of 
      5-minute epoxy applied. &nbsp;A short while later I was back on the road. 
      &nbsp;Being keen not to push my luck with this repair I figured that since 
      the split was fairly high up on the tank, only a few litres of fuel would 
      need to be consumed to get the fuel level down to below that of the split. 
      </P>

      <P align=justify>Over the next hundred miles or so, the weather improved 
      dramatically and I was really enjoying the ride towards the Alps with 
      thoughts that my problems must by now surely be over. &nbsp;Wrong! 
      &nbsp;Stopping for fuel at Albertville (making sure not to fill the tank 
      above the problem level), on returning to the bike it flatly refused to 
      start. &nbsp;It soon became apparent that there was no power reaching the 
      ignition circuit but luckily the broken connection at the main fuse holder 
      was quickly identified. &nbsp;A repair was quickly effected and it was 
      then back on the road - next stop Bardonecchia! &nbsp;As it happened, I 
      actually made several stops on route but only to take photographs - the 
      ride over the Col du Galibier affording some excellent views in 
      particular. &nbsp;Stopping on this pass, the Triumph soon attracted the 
      notice of several other Brit riders who were also heading for the Stella. 
      &nbsp;Although the brakes on the laden Triumph were performing 
      surprisingly well, I chose not to push my luck in attempting to keep up 
      with the others for the decent and final run to Bardonecchia. </P>
      <P align=justify>Day 3 - Saturday, 8th July. </P>
      <P align=justify>Whilst many riders attending the Stella Alpina rally now 
      favour hotel accommodation over camping, being a "hardened biker" it was 
      camping on hard ground and without an airbed for me! &nbsp;(Well actually, 
      having left the family at home, my conscience would not let me over 
      indulge on accommodation even though hotel rooms can be had for a 
      reasonable sum.) </P>
      <P align=justify>The morning was spent renewing old acquaintances from 
      previous Stellas and meeting up with a couple of friends who I had talked 
      into coming to the event. &nbsp;Unfortunately, due to work commitments, 
      they could not travel down until the Friday and planned to be back home by 
      the following Monday evening. &nbsp;However, given the problems that I had 
      experienced on route, I was glad that we had not travelled down together 
      with my being a burden to them. </P>
      <P align=justify>It was during the afternoon that someone suggested a 
      quick run up to a local viewpoint called Tre Croci (3 Crosses). &nbsp;It 
      is perhaps fair to advise anyone visiting Bardonecchia that should you 
      choose to undertake this run, I would not recommend undertaking this ride 
      alone. &nbsp;The narrow track consists of a mixture of large cobblestones, 
      potholes and mud, steeply winding up the side of a mountain to an 
      elevation of some 2700 feet above the town. &nbsp;The reward is an 
      excellent view from the top. &nbsp;On the down side (excuse the pun), 
      there is a very real risk of dropping your pride and joy. &nbsp;This year 
      a French friend of many years off-road riding experience dropped his K100 
      on three occasions, resulting in a fair degree of cosmetic damage to the 
      bike, and last year, a chap on a large Suzuki ending up being trapped 
      under his bike with fuel dripping onto him until help arrived. &nbsp;That 
      said, don’t be put off giving the Stella Alpina a try, since the 
      off-tarmac run up the Colle del Sommeiller is generally considerably less 
      hazardous. </P>
      <P align=justify>However, back to the 3 Crosses excursion. &nbsp;With one 
      of the guys amongst us having a CBR600 Honda, he rightly decided that his 
      bike was not suited to this run so, the fool that I am, I volunteered to 
      take him pillion. &nbsp;The ascent went well for the most part although 
      during the climb the altitude began to significantly reduce low engine 
      speed performance. &nbsp;Towards the top, I was forced to slip the clutch 
      to negotiate the regular and steep hairpin bends. &nbsp;Big mistake and 
      holiday breakdown No 4! &nbsp;Less than half a mile from the top and all 
      drive through the clutch was lost. &nbsp;Slackening the clutch cable and 
      leaving the bike for over half an hour to cool off failed to right the 
      situation, and not having a box spanner to effect an adjustment on the 
      clutch itself, left no choice but to freewheel the Triumph all the way 
      back down the track. &nbsp;Indeed, it says something for the gradient of 
      the track and some of the roads in Bardonecchia that I was able to 
      freewheel for some 20-30 minutes, making it to within a few yards of one 
      of the main garages, before I had to push. </P>
      <P align=justify>At the garage, the necessary spanner was borrowed, but 
      unfortunately, such was the wear on the clutch plates, that the main 
      adjuster screw separated from the clutch housing before the pressure was 
      released from the clutch push rod; not good! &nbsp;Short of replacing the 
      clutch friction plates (6 items of spares that I hadn’t brought with me!), 
      the only possible quick fix I could think of was to remove the clutch push 
      rod and reduce it in length by the total thickness of friction material 
      lost on the clutch plates. &nbsp;Thus, the push rod was removed without 
      too much difficulty through the clutch adjustment aperture and the garage 
      bench grinder used to remove some 4 to 5mm off the end. &nbsp;I did give 
      some thought to re-hardening and tempering the end of the push rod but 
      having been careful not to overheat the end during grinding, decided that 
      this was not necessary. &nbsp;On assembly, all appeared to work OK and 
      even though the clutch springs were now working under considerably less 
      pre-load, clutch engagement permitted the engine to be started. </P>
      <P align=justify>With every intention of "doing the Stella" on the Triumph 
      the next day (and indeed, of attending the Safari runs on the following 
      days thereafter), whilst I would not be riding two-up, I was concerned 
      about the weak spring pressure holding the clutch plates together. &nbsp;A 
      decision was made - the primary drive cover would have to come off and the 
      internal spring adjustment screws tweaked to restore the status quo. 
      &nbsp;In the absence of the factory tool (I’ve got one at home!), all that 
      was needed was a large slotted screwdriver. &nbsp;No problem - a visit to 
      the local tool store later and I fashioned the required item out of a tyre 
      lever with a newly acquired mini-hacksaw and file. &nbsp;Having also 
      purchased a box spanner to fit the main adjuster lock nut, I figured that 
      should any more shortening of the (albeit toughened) push rod be 
      subsequently necessary, I would at least now be self sufficient to effect 
      the repair. </P>
      <P align=justify>Being early evening by now, thoughts of a partial 
      dismantle job were put off until the next morning in favour of joining the 
      others for a meal and beverages. </P>
      <P align=justify>Day 4 - Sunday, 9th July. </P>
      <P align=justify>Up early, I decided to ride the bike from the campsite 
      and effect the surgery in a large car park opposite the hotel where most 
      of the others were staying, surmising that at least help would be readily 
      available should I need it. &nbsp;As it happened, another Brit was also 
      working on his Triumph (a Trophy Trail (TR5T?) on which the tab washer had 
      failed to stop the mainshaft nut unscrewing itself) and the use of his 
      socket set made my job all the easier, particularly in performing the 
      necessary removal of the LH footrest. &nbsp;A low wall, which I covered 
      with cardboard packaging borrowed from a skip outside the local bicycle 
      shop, permitted the bike to be lent over, negating the worry of losing the 
      oil contents from the primary drive and in no time the job was done. </P>
      <P align=justify>In a total contrast to the damp conditions and muddy 
      track of last year, this year’s run up the Colle del Sommeiller afforded 
      generally dry conditions albeit with a fair amount of dust being kicked up 
      by the steady stream of motorcycle traffic. &nbsp;The run up the mountain 
      track with two friends who had decided to wait for me to fix the bike, 
      brought with it the usual stunning scenery and regular stops were made for 
      photographs. &nbsp;A considerable thaw permitted the Stella rally control 
      to be established right at the top of the track this year in a dilapidated 
      ski lodge on the Colle, where we registered and bought the obligatory 
      badge and tee shirt. </P>
      <P align=justify>Apart from more splendid views looking over into France 
      as well as back down the valley we had just ridden up, entertainment was 
      provided as usual by numerous nutters on their motocrossers negotiating 
      the substantial area of snow. &nbsp;The really keen ones were making it up 
      considerable gradients with their departures from their bikes or just 
      getting stuck in the deep snow being met with cheers from the onlookers. 
      </P>

      <P align=justify>Back on the bike and riding alone down the track, a 
      French friend on his K100 accompanied by some Germans on large GSs caught 
      up with me. &nbsp;A stop for a chat established that, not having had 
      enough of rough-stuff riding, they were intent on extending their run to 
      take in the 3 Crosses; they not having been on this run the day before. 
      &nbsp;Not wishing to accept defeat from my previous attempt, I just had to 
      take advantage of this opportunity and an hour later we had negotiated the 
      climb and were admiring the view from the top. &nbsp;Unfortunately, as 
      mentioned before, the K100 was looking somewhat worse for wear by the time 
      we got back to Bardonecchia, the bike having taken the odd tumble. </P>
      <P align=justify>That evening, the conversation inevitably turned to the 
      subject of the Safari which this year would see us relocating some 50 
      miles (but a lot further by road!) SE of Bardonecchia to explore the 
      mountain tracks in that region. &nbsp;Compared to the Stella Alpina 
      itself, the Safari remains a low-key, personal invitation, event and 
      provides generally no more than 20 riders with a further opportunity to 
      ride off the beaten track. </P>
      <P align=justify>Day 5 - Monday, 10th July onwards. </P>
      <P align=justify>Monday brought with it rain - not the best of conditions 
      under which to have pack up the tent. &nbsp;The next few hours were then 
      spent in the company of a Brit rider on an R80GS riding in pretty 
      appalling conditions, but at least as we reached our final destination, 
      the weather was showing signs of improvement. </P>
      <P align=justify>Now located in a small village some 30 miles west of 
      Cuneo, I took advantage of the very favourable arrangements that Mario had 
      negotiated for accommodation, breakfast and evening meals. </P>

      <P align=justify>The next three days were spent exploring mountain tracks 
      that afforded many more photographic opportunities and brought with it 
      memorable events such as having to clear earth slides, riding through a 
      blizzard (although down in the valley the weather had been fine) and one 
      breakdown. &nbsp;Wrong! - not my Triumph but our French friend’s K100 with 
      a broken clutch cable. </P>
      <P align=justify>All too soon Friday dawned and it was time for me to head 
      for home. &nbsp;The farewells having been said (and bill paid) the night 
      before, I was on the road shortly after 6am and made good progress all the 
      way to Turin where I managed to get lost whilst negotiating the morning 
      rush hour. &nbsp;However, after Turin, respectable progress was made 
      towards the Grand St Bernard Pass, where during the ascent, sunny weather 
      gave way to rain that in turn gave way to a blizzard. &nbsp;At the border 
      crossing at the top, with me by then being nicely covered in a thin layer 
      of snow, even the guard took pity on me and just waved me through. 
      &nbsp;Previous years, we have been questioned as to our intentions for 
      transiting Switzerland; they being very keen to sell costly passes for 
      using their autoroutes. </P>
      <P align=justify>Descending into Switzerland, riding through the blizzard 
      was problem enough when the Triumph decides to throw one more problem at 
      me by running onto one cylinder. &nbsp;The problem was quickly diagnosed 
      as being due to the welded seam on the fuel tank chaffing though the 
      rubber collar that seals the spark plug cap at the entry point of the HT 
      lead. &nbsp;Unfortunately, even the smallest NGK caps sit too high for 
      this bike, but drying off the offending area as best I could and the 
      application of some insulating tape soon had me back on the road again. 
      </P>
      <P align=justify>Not using the autoroutes, Switzerland took ages to cross 
      and in rain for the most part. &nbsp;A new lesson for travelling in 
      Switzerland was also learnt - that of don’t expect to always be able to 
      pay for fuel by credit card. &nbsp;Unless I was just unfortunate with the 
      area that I was in at the time I needed fuel, all but one garage that I 
      came across were of the unmanned, automated type, requiring either a 
      currency note (of which I had none) or a credit card to be inserted into a 
      forecourt machine. &nbsp;At these fully automated stations it would appear 
      that credit cards issued in the UK are not accepted! </P>
      <P align=justify>Late in the afternoon and still raining, I entered 
      Germany and headed north on the autobahn. &nbsp;Riding until well after 
      sunset, an overnight stop was made in one of the autobahn minor rest areas 
      near Koblenz - the tent again being used. </P>
      <P align=justify>Saturday and not knowing the legality of camping in these 
      places, I was packed up and on the road again at first light and even the 
      weather was improving. &nbsp;With stops for alcohol-based provisions on 
      route, the run continued through Holland, Belgium, and France, and by late 
      afternoon I was back in Dover. </P>
      <P align=justify>Early evening and I finally I arrived home in 
      Bedfordshire to see that the kids (no doubt with some significant 
      encouragement from my Annie) had decorated the garage door with a large 
      banner reading "How many breakdowns?!!" </P>
      <P align=justify><I>Since returning home, the question of "Would I do it 
      again?" keeps entering my mind. &nbsp;Given similar circumstances (in 
      particular that of travelling alone so as not to be a possible burden on 
      others) the answer is definitely yes, since for all the swearing under my 
      breath at each breakdown, fixing each problem brought with it a real sense 
      of achievement. &nbsp;There again, maybe I’m just certifiable!</I>
