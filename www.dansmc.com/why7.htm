<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> Wow! Here we are. We just might make it. The old goat fart of the government is gone. Do I really have to tell you who that old goat fart is?

<P>



<P>It is Joe Biden, his crew and the entire, left wing and progressive, Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> party. He and his people have hated and hurt The United States of America for four long years. The Progressive Democ<font size=5><B>rats</B></font> have done not one thing right. Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> City Majors have ruined our great cities and Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> State Governors have ruined our Great States. They have stolen our Citizenship rights and given them to criminals. Joe Biden and family are traitors to to our great nation. Thank you Jesus they are now gone. All we have to do now is clean up the mess they have left behind.

<P>President Trump is going to do that. I'm going to help him any way I can. Will you? 

<P>Everything the The old goat farts Biden and the Progrssives said about President Trump in the last four, what am I saying, the last nine years has been a traitorous lie. Not to mention as he ran out the door he pardoned his own family.


<P>Now explain to me how Special Counsel Robert Hur’s portrait of a man who couldn’t remember when he served as Barack Obama’s vice president, or the year when his beloved son Beau died, is fit enough to issue pardons?

<P>If you wonder why I call him and the Democ<font size=5><B>rat</B></font> goat farts look at what God says about sheep and goats.

<P>Matthew 25:31-46
<BR>King James Version


<P>"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

<P>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 

<P>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."


<P> The following verses from Isaiah were famously voiced by Jesus in Luke 4:18-19 and applied to himself:

<P> "The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor" Isaiah 61:1-2


<P>Luke 4:18-19:<BR>

 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."


<P> Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free” Psalm 118:5

<BR><BR>
The people of the United States of America are now FREE. Thank you Jesus!

<center><h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS<BR> TO ME<BR></H1></center>


<center><h2><B>UPDATE! <BR> 2021 and forward<BR></B></H2></center>


<P><font size=4>Well, I give up. No one ever sends me any comments that disagree with my comments. No noth'en, nada, zip, zero, nothing. I am sorry to say but it must be true. The Progressive Democrats have based all they say on NOTHING. Oh well, you can still E-mail me.


<P>
<strike>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!</strike>
