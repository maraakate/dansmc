<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182; "But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

<P>Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you. For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

<P>As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. 

<P>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

<P>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

<P> The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?"</B>

<P></font><font face="tahoma" size=4>Jeremiah 5:23-31

<P>As I look at the state of our nation today the truth of the Biblical statement <B>"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so:"</B> really hits home.

<P>Hillary Clinton, the Benghazi Babe, grasping for a third Obama term, is now outed as a traitor to our country. Selling influence and uranium for millions of dollars. Yet people still want to vote for her because she is a woman. Yes sir, she stood by her man, her "I did not have sex with that woman" liar of a husband. 

<P>Back when the Lewinsky scandal went down I asked my "Burn your bra" liberal, feminist sister, who I love dearly, what she thought of it. She said and I quote "He's just an alpha male." So I guess that makes it OK, Huh?

<P>Watching the Clinton supporters scramble for a justification of her actions certainly is the ultimate in farce. <B>"and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?"</B>

<P>I have difficulty understanding why anyone would still support her. If a Republican was doing this I would turn against he or she instantly. You have to remember one thing about all thieves. If they will steal for you, sooner or later they will steal from you. All these inconvenient laws and rules must apply to EVERYONE. Not to just the great unwashed. They have to apply to the ELITE people too.

<P>That is a problem ALL government people seem to have. They love to make rules for others but NEVER want those rules to apply to themselves. Again, <B>"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so:"</B>

<P>They say she plans to run on revitalizing the economy by doing more of the things that tanked it in the first place. If you rob from Peter to pay Paul you can always count on Paul's vote. The only trouble is that, because he is loosing money, Peter is just not taking risks in new businesses. There is no profit in it. So Paul lives on government handouts instead of getting a job, working hard, making a lot of money. Paul is afraid he will make too much money and loose his government subsidy.

<P>Government is killing the economy. Want an example? Every time I go to my Doctor now I have to sign a form that says I give them <a href="http://thewei.com/kimi/must-i-sign-my-doctors-hipaa-policy-receipt-form/" target="_blank">permission</A> to treat me. So why do you think I went to see the Doctor? To play cards? Why does the Doctor have to waste time and money on a piece of paper that states the obvious? Multiply that a hundred million times and you can see why we are going broke. 

<P>All that money will NOT come from the rich. They have accountants and lawyers whose jobs depend on them coming up with ways the rich will NOT pay. Do you have "People" who will help you? No? You are not alone. I don't have any either.

<P>I'll give you another example. You are poor. Can't afford health insurance. So the government forces you to buy health insurance. But they are so sweet. They give you a subsidy and, lucky you, you don't make enough money for them to force you to give the subsidy back! So now you get a subsidized insurance policy and it is cheap. You only have to pay hundred bucks a month or so. 

<P>HOWEVER, the policy has a $5000.00 deductible. So, bottom line, you get to pay the insurance companies money every month and YOU STILL DO NOT HAVE USABLE HEALTH INSURACE. I wonder where you will come up with the monthly money for that cheap, subsidized, health insurance? Maybe give up meals one day a week. You are probably too fat anyway and you know that leads to Diabetes. Don't worry, after you pay the $5000.00 deductible your Diabetes will be covered. With a co-pay of course. Maybe up that to no meals two days a week. Still want to vote for more big government?

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
