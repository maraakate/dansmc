001:001 <TD><font size=5>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
        Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto
        you, saith the LORD of hosts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
        cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from
        your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not
        hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live
        for ever? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
        the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
        returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do
        unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
        so hath he dealt with us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
        is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
        he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
        behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
        talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
        said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and
        fro through the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
        myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
        earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at
        rest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
        how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
        cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
        threescore and ten years? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
        words and comfortable words. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for
        Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
        ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
        forward the affliction. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
        mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities
        through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
        shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?
        And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
        Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And the LORD shewed me four carpenters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
        These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
        did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast
        out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
        the land of Judah to scatter it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
        a measuring line in his hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
        measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and
        what is the length thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
        another angel went out to meet him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
        Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the
        multitude of men and cattle therein: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
        about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
        the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of
        the heaven, saith the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
        Babylon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
        me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
        you toucheth the apple of his eye. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
        be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
        of hosts hath sent me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I
        will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and
        shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and
        thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
        and shall choose Jerusalem again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up
        out of his holy habitation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
        angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to
        resist him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;
        even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
        this a brand plucked out of the fire? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
        the angel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
        saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
        he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
        thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
        set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
        And the angel of the LORD stood by. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
        and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
        house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee
        places to walk among these that stand by. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
        sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I
        will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
        stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
        thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the
        iniquity of that land in one day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man
        his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as
        a man that is wakened out of his sleep. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
        and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top
        of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
        seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
        bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
        saying, What are these, my lord? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
        Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word
        of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
        power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
        become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
        with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
        house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know
        that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
        rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
        with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to
        and fro through the whole earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive
        trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left
        side thereof? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two
        olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the
        golden oil out of themselves? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?
        And I said, No, my lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by
        the LORD of the whole earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold

        flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof ten cubits. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over
        the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall
        be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that
        sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall
        enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him
        that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the
        midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber
        thereof and the stones thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
        me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth
        forth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that
        goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance
        through all the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is
        a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
        had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the
        ephah between the earth and the heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these

014:006<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall
        not be clear, nor dark: </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:007<TD><font size=5>But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not
        day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
        time it shall be light. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:008<TD><font size=5>And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out
        from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
        of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall
        it be. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:009<TD><font size=5>And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day
        shall there be one LORD, and his name one. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:010<TD><font size=5>All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
        south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited
        in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first
        gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel
        unto the king's winepresses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:011<TD><font size=5>And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
        destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:012<TD><font size=5>And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
        the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh
        shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their
        eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall
        consume away in their mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:013<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult
        from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
        every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall
        rise up against the hand of his neighbour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:014<TD><font size=5>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
        the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
        silver, and apparel, in great abundance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:015<TD><font size=5>And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
        camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in
        these tents, as this plague. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:016<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
        the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from
        year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to
        keep the feast of tabernacles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:017<TD><font size=5>And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the
        families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
        LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:018<TD><font size=5>And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have
        no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
        smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
        tabernacles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:019<TD><font size=5>This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
        all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:020<TD><font size=5>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
        HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall
        be like the bowls before the altar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:021<TD><font size=5>Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
        unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
        and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there
        shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of
        hosts.</font>
