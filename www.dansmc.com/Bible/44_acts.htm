<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
        Jesus began both to do and teach, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
        the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom
        he had chosen: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
        infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking
        of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
        they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
        promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
        with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
        saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
        to Israel? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
        the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
        upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
        and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
        of the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
        taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
        behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
        into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
        heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
        into heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called
        Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
        where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,
        Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of
        Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>These all continued with one accord in prayer and
        supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
        and with his brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the
        disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about
        an hundred and twenty,) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
        fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
        before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took
        Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
        ministry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
        and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all
        his bowels gushed out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
        as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
        is to say, The field of blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
        desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let
        another take. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the
        time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he
        was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
        with us of his resurrection. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
        surnamed Justus, and Matthias. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the
        hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
        which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
        place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon
        Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
        with one accord in one place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
        mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
        sitting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
        and it sat upon each of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
        speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
        every nation under heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
        and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak
        in his own language. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
        Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
        born? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
        Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and
        Asia, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
        about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the
        wonderful works of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
        another, What meaneth this? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
        and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at
        Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the
        third hour of the day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
        pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
        daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see
        visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
        those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the
        earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
        blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
        name of the Lord shall be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
        approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
        which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves
        also know: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
        crucified and slain: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
        because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
        before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not
        be moved: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
        moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:027<TD><font size=5>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
        suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:028<TD><font size=5>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
        me full of joy with thy countenance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:029<TD><font size=5>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
        patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
        sepulchre is with us unto this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:030<TD><font size=5>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
        an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
        the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:031<TD><font size=5>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
        that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
        corruption. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:032<TD><font size=5>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:033<TD><font size=5>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
        received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
        shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:034<TD><font size=5>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
        himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right
        hand, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:035<TD><font size=5>Until I make thy foes thy footstool. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:036<TD><font size=5>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
        hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
        and Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:037<TD><font size=5>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart,
        and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and
        brethren, what shall we do? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:038<TD><font size=5>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
        of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
        and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:039<TD><font size=5>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
        that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall
        call. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:040<TD><font size=5>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
        Save yourselves from this untoward generation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:041<TD><font size=5>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
        same day there were added unto them about three thousand
        souls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:042<TD><font size=5>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
        fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:043<TD><font size=5>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
        done by the apostles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:044<TD><font size=5>And all that believed were together, and had all things
        common; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:045<TD><font size=5>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
        men, as every man had need. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:046<TD><font size=5>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
        breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
        gladness and singleness of heart, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:047<TD><font size=5>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
        Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
        hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
        whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
        Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an
        alms. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
        on us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
        them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
        have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
        up and walk. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
        immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
        into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>And all the people saw him walking and praising God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
        Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder
        and amazement at that which had happened unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all
        the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
        Solomon's, greatly wondering. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
        Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
        us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
        man to walk? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
        fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
        and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
        determined to let him go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
        murderer to be granted unto you; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
        dead; whereof we are witnesses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
        strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
        hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
        all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as
        did also your rulers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of
        all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
        fulfilled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
        blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
        presence of the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
        you: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of
        all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
        prophets since the world began. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
        Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
        me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say
        unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not
        hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
        after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
        days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
        God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy
        seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
        to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
        iniquities. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the
        captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached
        through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the
        next day: for it was now eventide. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the
        number of the men was about five thousand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and
        elders, and scribes, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
        Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high
        priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
        power, or by what name, have ye done this? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
        rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the
        impotent man, by what means he is made whole; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
        that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye
        crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth
        this man stand here before you whole. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
        which is become the head of the corner. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
        other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
        saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
        perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
        marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been
        with Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
        they could say nothing against it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the
        council, they conferred among themselves, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a
        notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them
        that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>But that it spread no further among the people, let us
        straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man
        in this name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
        nor teach in the name of Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
        right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
        God, judge ye. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
        heard. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
        finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
        people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
        healing was shewed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
        all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
        with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made
        heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:025<TD><font size=5>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
        heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:026<TD><font size=5>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
        together against the Lord, and against his Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:027<TD><font size=5>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
        anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
        and the people of Israel, were gathered together, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:028<TD><font size=5>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
        before to be done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:029<TD><font size=5>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
        servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:030<TD><font size=5>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
        wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:031<TD><font size=5>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
        assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy
        Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:032<TD><font size=5>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
        of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things

        common. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:033<TD><font size=5>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the

004:034<TD><font size=5>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as

004:035<TD><font size=5>And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was
        made unto every man according as he had need. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:036<TD><font size=5>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which

        of the country of Cyprus, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:037<TD><font size=5>Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at

        it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'

005:003<TD><font size=5>But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to

        the land? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was

        unto God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the

005:006<TD><font size=5>And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out,

005:007<TD><font size=5>And it was about the space of three hours after, when his
        wife, not knowing what was done, came in. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land

005:009<TD><font size=5>Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed

        carry thee out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the

005:011<TD><font size=5>And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
        heard these things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
        wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord

005:013<TD><font size=5>And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the

005:015<TD><font size=5>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,

005:016<TD><font size=5>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto

005:017<TD><font size=5>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,

        indignation, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the

        of this life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early
        in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they
        that were with him, and called the council together, and all
        the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison
        to have them brought. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
        they returned and told, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:023<TD><font size=5>Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
        the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had
        opened, we found no man within. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:024<TD><font size=5>Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
        chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them
        whereunto this would grow. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:025<TD><font size=5>Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye
        put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the
        people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:026<TD><font size=5>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
        without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should
        have been stoned. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:027<TD><font size=5>And when they had brought them, they set them before the
        council: and the high priest asked them, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:028<TD><font size=5>Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not
        teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with
        your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:029<TD><font size=5>Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
        to obey God rather than men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:030<TD><font size=5>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and
        hanged on a tree. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:031<TD><font size=5>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
        Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
        sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:032<TD><font size=5>And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
        Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:033<TD><font size=5>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
        counsel to slay them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:034<TD><font size=5>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
        Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the
        people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little
        space; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:035<TD><font size=5>And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
        what ye intend to do as touching these men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:036<TD><font size=5>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
        somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
        themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,
        were scattered, and brought to nought. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:037<TD><font size=5>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
        taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished;
        and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:038<TD><font size=5>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
        alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
        come to nought: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:039<TD><font size=5>But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be
        found even to fight against God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:040<TD><font size=5>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
        and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
        the name of Jesus, and let them go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:041<TD><font size=5>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
        that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:042<TD><font size=5>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not
        to teach and preach Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:002<TD><font size=5>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto

008:033<TD><font size=5>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall

008:037<TD><font size=5>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou

        unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about
        the sixth hour: </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:010<TD><font size=5>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
        they made ready, he fell into a trance, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:011<TD><font size=5>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon
        him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners,
        and let down to the earth: </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:012<TD><font size=5>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
        wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:013<TD><font size=5>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:014<TD><font size=5>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
        that is common or unclean. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:015<TD><font size=5>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
        hath cleansed, that call not thou common. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:016<TD><font size=5>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
        into heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:017<TD><font size=5>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
        had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
        Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
        the gate, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:018<TD><font size=5>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
        were lodged there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:019<TD><font size=5>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
        Behold, three men seek thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:020<TD><font size=5>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
        nothing: for I have sent them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:021<TD><font size=5>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
        Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the
        cause wherefore ye are come? </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:022<TD><font size=5>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
        that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of
        the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
        thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:023<TD><font size=5>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
        Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
        accompanied him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:024<TD><font size=5>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
        waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and
        near friends. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:025<TD><font size=5>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
        at his feet, and worshipped him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:026<TD><font size=5>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a
        man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:027<TD><font size=5>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that
        were come together. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:028<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
        thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto
        one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should
        not call any man common or unclean. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:029<TD><font size=5>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
        sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:030<TD><font size=5>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
        hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold,
        a man stood before me in bright clothing, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:031<TD><font size=5>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are
        had in remembrance in the sight of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:032<TD><font size=5>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname
        is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by
        the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:033<TD><font size=5>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
        that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
        before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:034<TD><font size=5>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
        that God is no respecter of persons: </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:035<TD><font size=5>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
        righteousness, is accepted with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:036<TD><font size=5>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
        peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:037<TD><font size=5>That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all
        Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
        preached; </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:038<TD><font size=5>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
        with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that
        were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:039<TD><font size=5>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
        land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged
        on a tree: </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:040<TD><font size=5>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:041<TD><font size=5>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God,
        even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from
        the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:042<TD><font size=5>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
        that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
        quick and dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:043<TD><font size=5>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
        whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:044<TD><font size=5>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
        them which heard the word. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:045<TD><font size=5>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
        as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
        was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:046<TD><font size=5>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
        answered Peter, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:047<TD><font size=5>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
        which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:048<TD><font size=5>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
        Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>011:001 <TD><font size=5>And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
        the Gentiles had also received the word of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:002<TD><font size=5>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
        circumcision contended with him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:003<TD><font size=5>Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
        with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:004<TD><font size=5>But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and
        expounded it by order unto them, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:005<TD><font size=5>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
        vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great
        sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even
        to me: </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:006<TD><font size=5>Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
        and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
        creeping things, and fowls of the air. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:007<TD><font size=5>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
        eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:008<TD><font size=5>But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
        at any time entered into my mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:009<TD><font size=5>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
        cleansed, that call not thou common. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:010<TD><font size=5>And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
        into heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:011<TD><font size=5>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
        unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:012<TD><font size=5>And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
        Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered
        into the man's house: </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:013<TD><font size=5>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
        stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
        Simon, whose surname is Peter; </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:014<TD><font size=5>Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
        shall be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:015<TD><font size=5>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
        at the beginning. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:016<TD><font size=5>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
        indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the
        Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:017<TD><font size=5>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto
        us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
        could withstand God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:018<TD><font size=5>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
        glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles
        granted repentance unto life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:019<TD><font size=5>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
        arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
        and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews
        only. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:020<TD><font size=5>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
        they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
        the LORD Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:021<TD><font size=5>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
        believed, and turned unto the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:022<TD><font size=5>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
        which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he
        should go as far as Antioch. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:023<TD><font size=5>Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
        and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
        cleave unto the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:024<TD><font size=5>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of
        faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:025<TD><font size=5>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:026<TD><font size=5>And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it
        came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
        the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
        called Christians first in Antioch. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:027<TD><font size=5>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:028<TD><font size=5>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
        the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all
        the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:029<TD><font size=5>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
        determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
        Judaea: </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:030<TD><font size=5>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
        Barnabas and Saul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>012:001 <TD><font size=5>Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
        to vex certain of the church. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:002<TD><font size=5>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:003<TD><font size=5>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
        to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:004<TD><font size=5>And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
        delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;
        intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:005<TD><font size=5>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
        without ceasing of the church unto God for him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:006<TD><font size=5>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
        Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
        chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:007<TD><font size=5>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
        shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and
        raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell
        off from his hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:008<TD><font size=5>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
        sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy
        garment about thee, and follow me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:009<TD><font size=5>And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
        true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:010<TD><font size=5>When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
        unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
        them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on
        through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:011<TD><font size=5>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
        surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
        me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
        the people of the Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:012<TD><font size=5>And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
        Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
        were gathered together praying. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:013<TD><font size=5>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
        hearken, named Rhoda. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:014<TD><font size=5>And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
        gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the
        gate. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:015<TD><font size=5>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
        affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:016<TD><font size=5>But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the
        door, and saw him, they were astonished. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:017<TD><font size=5>But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
        declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the

        the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:018<TD><font size=5>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
        soldiers, what was become of Peter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:019<TD><font size=5>And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
        examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
        death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there
        abode. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:020<TD><font size=5>And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:

012:021<TD><font size=5>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon

013:022<TD><font size=5>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to

013:023<TD><font size=5>Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised

013:026<TD><font size=5>Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and

013:027<TD><font size=5>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
        they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which

013:034<TD><font size=5>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no

        give you the sure mercies of David. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:035<TD><font size=5>Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not

013:036<TD><font size=5>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will

013:042<TD><font size=5>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles

013:043<TD><font size=5>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
        religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking

013:044<TD><font size=5>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together

        Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:046<TD><font size=5>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
        that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but

        everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:047<TD><font size=5>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to

013:048<TD><font size=5>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and

013:050<TD><font size=5>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and

013:051<TD><font size=5>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and

014:002<TD><font size=5>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made

014:003<TD><font size=5>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
        which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
        signs and wonders to be done by their hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:004<TD><font size=5>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with

014:005<TD><font size=5>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and

014:006<TD><font size=5>They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities

014:007<TD><font size=5>And there they preached the gospel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:008<TD><font size=5>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
        being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:009<TD><font size=5>The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
        perceiving that he had faith to be healed, </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:010<TD><font size=5>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
        leaped and walked. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:011<TD><font size=5>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
        their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are
        come down to us in the likeness of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:012<TD><font size=5>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
        because he was the chief speaker. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:013<TD><font size=5>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
        brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done
        sacrifice with the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:014<TD><font size=5>Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
        rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:015<TD><font size=5>And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
        like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should
        turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
        heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
        therein: </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:016<TD><font size=5>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
        ways. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:017<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
        did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
        filling our hearts with food and gladness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:018<TD><font size=5>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
        they had not done sacrifice unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:019<TD><font size=5>And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
        who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out
        of the city, supposing he had been dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:020<TD><font size=5>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
        and came into the city: and the next day he departed with
        Barnabas to Derbe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:021<TD><font size=5>And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
        taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,

014:022<TD><font size=5>Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
        continue in the faith, and that we must through much

014:023<TD><font size=5>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and
        had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
        whom they believed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:024<TD><font size=5>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
        Pamphylia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        recommended to the grace of God for the work which they
        fulfilled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:027<TD><font size=5>And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
        they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had
        opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:028<TD><font size=5>And there they abode long time with the disciples. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>015:001 <TD><font size=5>And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the

015:002<TD><font size=5>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
        disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,

        apostles and elders about this question. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:003<TD><font size=5>And being brought on their way by the church, they passed
        through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the
        Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:004<TD><font size=5>And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
        the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared
        all things that God had done with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:005<TD><font size=5>But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
        believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and
        to command them to keep the law of Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:006<TD><font size=5>And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
        this matter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:007<TD><font size=5>And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
        said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good
        while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my
        mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:008<TD><font size=5>And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
        them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:009<TD><font size=5>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
        hearts by faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:010<TD><font size=5>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
        the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
        bear? </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:011<TD><font size=5>But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
        we shall be saved, even as they. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:012<TD><font size=5>Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
        Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
        wrought among the Gentiles by them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:013<TD><font size=5>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
        Men and brethren, hearken unto me: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:014<TD><font size=5>Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
        Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:015<TD><font size=5>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:016<TD><font size=5>After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
        of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the
        ruins thereof, and I will set it up: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:017<TD><font size=5>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
        Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who
        doeth all these things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:018<TD><font size=5>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
        world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:019<TD><font size=5>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
        among the Gentiles are turned to God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:020<TD><font size=5>But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
        of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and
        from blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:021<TD><font size=5>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
        being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:022<TD><font size=5>Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
        to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul
        and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief
        men among the brethren: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:023<TD><font size=5>And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles
        and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
        are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:024<TD><font size=5>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
        us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
        saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we
        gave no such commandment: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:025<TD><font size=5>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
        send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:026<TD><font size=5>Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
        Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:027<TD><font size=5>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
        you the same things by mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:028<TD><font size=5>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
        you no greater burden than these necessary things; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:029<TD><font size=5>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
        and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if
        ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:030<TD><font size=5>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
        they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
        epistle: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:031<TD><font size=5>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:032<TD><font size=5>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
        the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:033<TD><font size=5>And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
        peace from the brethren unto the apostles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:034<TD><font size=5>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:035<TD><font size=5>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
        preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:036<TD><font size=5>And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
        and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached
        the word of the LORD, and see how they do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:037<TD><font size=5>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
        was Mark. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:038<TD><font size=5>But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
        from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:039<TD><font size=5>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they
        departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took
        Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:040<TD><font size=5>And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
        brethren unto the grace of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:041<TD><font size=5>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
        churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>016:001 <TD><font size=5>Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
        disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain
        woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a
        Greek: </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:002<TD><font size=5>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
        and Iconium. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:003<TD><font size=5>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and

        quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:004<TD><font size=5>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
        decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and
        elders which were at Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:005<TD><font size=5>And so were the churches established in the faith, and
        increased in number daily. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:006<TD><font size=5>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of

        word in Asia, </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:007<TD><font size=5>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
        Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:008<TD><font size=5>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:009<TD><font size=5>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
        of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
        Macedonia, and help us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:010<TD><font size=5>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
        to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
        called us for to preach the gospel unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:011<TD><font size=5>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
        to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:012<TD><font size=5>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
        part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city
        abiding certain days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:013<TD><font size=5>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
        where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
        unto the women which resorted thither. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:014<TD><font size=5>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the

        spoken of Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:015<TD><font size=5>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
        saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
        into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:016<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
        possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought
        her masters much gain by soothsaying: </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:017<TD><font size=5>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
        are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the
        way of salvation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:018<TD><font size=5>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
        and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
        Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:019<TD><font size=5>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
        gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the
        marketplace unto the rulers, </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:020<TD><font size=5>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being
        Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:021<TD><font size=5>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
        neither to observe, being Romans. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:022<TD><font size=5>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
        magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat
        them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:023<TD><font size=5>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
        into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:024<TD><font size=5>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
        prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:025<TD><font size=5>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
        God: and the prisoners heard them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:026<TD><font size=5>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
        foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
        doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:027<TD><font size=5>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
        seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
        have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been
        fled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:028<TD><font size=5>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
        for we are all here. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:029<TD><font size=5>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
        and fell down before Paul and Silas, </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:030<TD><font size=5>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
        saved? </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:031<TD><font size=5>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
        shalt be saved, and thy house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:032<TD><font size=5>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
        were in his house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:033<TD><font size=5>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
        stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:034<TD><font size=5>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
        before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
        house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:035<TD><font size=5>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
        saying, Let those men go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:036<TD><font size=5>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
        magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and
        go in peace. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:037<TD><font size=5>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly
        uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and
        now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them
        come themselves and fetch us out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:038<TD><font size=5>And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
        they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:039<TD><font size=5>And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
        desired them to depart out of the city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

016:040<TD><font size=5>And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
        Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
        them, and departed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>017:001 <TD><font size=5>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
        they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:002<TD><font size=5>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
        sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:003<TD><font size=5>Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
        and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I
        preach unto you, is Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:004<TD><font size=5>And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
        and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
        women not a few. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:005<TD><font size=5>But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
        them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
        company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
        house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:006<TD><font size=5>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
        brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have
        turned the world upside down are come hither also; </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:007<TD><font size=5>Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
        decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one
        Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:008<TD><font size=5>And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
        they heard these things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:009<TD><font size=5>And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
        they let them go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:010<TD><font size=5>And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
        unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
        Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:011<TD><font size=5>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
        received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
        scriptures daily, whether those things were so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:012<TD><font size=5>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
        which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:013<TD><font size=5>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
        of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
        and stirred up the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:014<TD><font size=5>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
        were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:015<TD><font size=5>And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
        receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
        to him with all speed, they departed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:016<TD><font size=5>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
        stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:017<TD><font size=5>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
        the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met
        with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:018<TD><font size=5>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
        Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this
        babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of
        strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the
        resurrection. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:019<TD><font size=5>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
        we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:020<TD><font size=5>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
        know therefore what these things mean. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:021<TD><font size=5>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
        their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear
        some new thing.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:022<TD><font size=5>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men
        of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
        superstitious. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:023<TD><font size=5>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
        altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
        therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:024<TD><font size=5>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
        is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
        hands; </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:025<TD><font size=5>Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
        any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
        things; </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:026<TD><font size=5>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
        all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
        before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:027<TD><font size=5>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
        him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:028<TD><font size=5>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
        also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
        offspring. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:029<TD><font size=5>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
        think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
        graven by art and man's device. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:030<TD><font size=5>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
        commandeth all men every where to repent: </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:031<TD><font size=5>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
        the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
        whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
        raised him from the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:032<TD><font size=5>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
        mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this
        matter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:033<TD><font size=5>So Paul departed from among them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

017:034<TD><font size=5>Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
        which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
        and others with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>018:001 <TD><font size=5>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
        Corinth; </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:002<TD><font size=5>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
        come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that
        Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came
        unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:003<TD><font size=5>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
        wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:004<TD><font size=5>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
        the Jews and the Greeks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:005<TD><font size=5>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
        was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that
        Jesus was Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:006<TD><font size=5>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
        raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
        heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the
        Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:007<TD><font size=5>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's
        house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house
        joined hard to the synagogue. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:008<TD><font size=5>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
        Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
        believed, and were baptized. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:009<TD><font size=5>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
        afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:010<TD><font size=5>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
        for I have much people in this city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:011<TD><font size=5>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the
        word of God among them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:012<TD><font size=5>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
        insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to
        the judgment seat, </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:013<TD><font size=5>Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to
        the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:014<TD><font size=5>And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said
        unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked
        lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:015<TD><font size=5>But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
        look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:016<TD><font size=5>And he drave them from the judgment seat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:017<TD><font size=5>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
        synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio
        cared for none of those things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:018<TD><font size=5>And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
        took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
        and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in
        Cenchrea: for he had a vow. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:019<TD><font size=5>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
        entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:020<TD><font size=5>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
        consented not; </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:021<TD><font size=5>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
        feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
        you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:022<TD><font size=5>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
        the church, he went down to Antioch. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:023<TD><font size=5>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
        over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
        strengthening all the disciples. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:024<TD><font size=5>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
        eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:025<TD><font size=5>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
        fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the
        things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:026<TD><font size=5>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when
        Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and
        expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:027<TD><font size=5>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
        wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he
        was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:028<TD><font size=5>For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly,
        shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>019:001 <TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
        having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and
        finding certain disciples, </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:002<TD><font size=5>He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye

019:003<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And

019:004<TD><font size=5>Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
        repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe
        on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:005<TD><font size=5>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
        Lord Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:006<TD><font size=5>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
        came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:007<TD><font size=5>And all the men were about twelve. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:008<TD><font size=5>And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
        of three months, disputing and persuading the things
        concerning the kingdom of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:009<TD><font size=5>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
        evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
        and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of
        one Tyrannus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:010<TD><font size=5>And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
        which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both
        Jews and Greeks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:011<TD><font size=5>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:012<TD><font size=5>So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
        or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil
        spirits went out of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:013<TD><font size=5>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
        to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD
        Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:014<TD><font size=5>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of
        the priests, which did so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:015<TD><font size=5>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
        I know; but who are ye? </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:016<TD><font size=5>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
        overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
        out of that house naked and wounded. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:017<TD><font size=5>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
        Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
        Jesus was magnified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:018<TD><font size=5>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
        deeds. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:019<TD><font size=5>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
        together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the
        price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:020<TD><font size=5>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:021<TD><font size=5>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
        when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
        Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see
        Rome. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:022<TD><font size=5>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto

        a season. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:023<TD><font size=5>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:024<TD><font size=5>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
        silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
        craftsmen; </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:025<TD><font size=5>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
        and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:026<TD><font size=5>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but

        turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which
        are made with hands: </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:027<TD><font size=5>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
        nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
        should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed,
        whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:028<TD><font size=5>And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
        and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:029<TD><font size=5>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having
        caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's
        companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the
        theatre. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:030<TD><font size=5>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
        disciples suffered him not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:031<TD><font size=5>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
        unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself
        into the theatre. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:032<TD><font size=5>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
        assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore
        they were come together. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:033<TD><font size=5>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
        him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would
        have made his defence unto the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:034<TD><font size=5>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
        the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the
        Ephesians. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:035<TD><font size=5>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
        men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that
        the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess
        Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:036<TD><font size=5>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
        ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:037<TD><font size=5>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither
        robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:038<TD><font size=5>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
        have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
        deputies: let them implead one another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:039<TD><font size=5>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
        be determined in a lawful assembly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:040<TD><font size=5>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
        uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of
        this concourse. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:041<TD><font size=5>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>020:001 <TD><font size=5>And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
        disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into
        Macedonia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:002<TD><font size=5>And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
        exhortation, he came into Greece, </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:003<TD><font size=5>And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
        him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return
        through Macedonia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:004<TD><font size=5>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
        the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of
        Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:005<TD><font size=5>These going before tarried for us at Troas. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:006<TD><font size=5>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
        bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we
        abode seven days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:007<TD><font size=5>And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
        together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to
        depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:008<TD><font size=5>And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
        were gathered together. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:009<TD><font size=5>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
        being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long
        preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the
        third loft, and was taken up dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:010<TD><font size=5>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
        Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:011<TD><font size=5>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
        eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
        departed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:012<TD><font size=5>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
        comforted. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:013<TD><font size=5>And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
        intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding
        himself to go afoot. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:014<TD><font size=5>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
        Mitylene. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:015<TD><font size=5>And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against
        Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at
        Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:016<TD><font size=5>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
        not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
        for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:017<TD><font size=5>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
        the church. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:018<TD><font size=5>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
        from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
        have been with you at all seasons, </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:019<TD><font size=5>Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many
        tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
        of the Jews: </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:020<TD><font size=5>And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but
        have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house
        to house, </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:021<TD><font size=5>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
        repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:022<TD><font size=5>And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
        knowing the things that shall befall me there: </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:023<TD><font size=5>Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
        bonds and afflictions abide me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:024<TD><font size=5>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
        unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
        the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
        testify the gospel of the grace of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:025<TD><font size=5>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
        preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:026<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
        the blood of all men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:027<TD><font size=5>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:028<TD><font size=5>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
        over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
        the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:029<TD><font size=5>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
        enter in among you, not sparing the flock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:030<TD><font size=5>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
        things, to draw away disciples after them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:031<TD><font size=5>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
        years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:032<TD><font size=5>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
        his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
        inheritance among all them which are sanctified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:033<TD><font size=5>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:034<TD><font size=5>Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
        my necessities, and to them that were with me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:035<TD><font size=5>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
        to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
        Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to
        receive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:036<TD><font size=5>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
        them all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:037<TD><font size=5>And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed
        him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:038<TD><font size=5>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
        should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the
        ship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>021:001 <TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and

021:002<TD><font size=5>And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,

        ship was to unlade her burden. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:004<TD><font size=5>And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
        to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:005<TD><font size=5>And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
        our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and
        children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
        the shore, and prayed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:006<TD><font size=5>And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
        and they returned home again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:007<TD><font size=5>And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
        Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one
        day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:008<TD><font size=5>And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
        came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip
        the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:009<TD><font size=5>And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
        prophesy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:010<TD><font size=5>And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
        a certain prophet, named Agabus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:011<TD><font size=5>And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
        his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
        So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this
        girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:012<TD><font size=5>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
        place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:013<TD><font size=5>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
        heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
        Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:014<TD><font size=5>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
        will of the Lord be done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:015<TD><font size=5>And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:016<TD><font size=5>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
        and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,
        with whom we should lodge. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:017<TD><font size=5>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
        gladly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:018<TD><font size=5>And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
        the elders were present. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:019<TD><font size=5>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
        things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:020<TD><font size=5>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
        him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are
        which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:021<TD><font size=5>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
        which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
        they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
        after the customs. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:022<TD><font size=5>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
        for they will hear that thou art come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:023<TD><font size=5>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
        have a vow on them; </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:024<TD><font size=5>Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
        with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know
        that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
        are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and
        keepest the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:025<TD><font size=5>As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
        concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they
        keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood,
        and from strangled, and from fornication. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:026<TD><font size=5>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
        with them entered into the temple, to signify the
        accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an
        offering should be offered for every one of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:027<TD><font size=5>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
        of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
        people, and laid hands on him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:028<TD><font size=5>Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
        teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law,
        and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the
        temple, and hath polluted this holy place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:029<TD><font size=5>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
        Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
        temple.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:030<TD><font size=5>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
        they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith
        the doors were shut. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:031<TD><font size=5>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
        chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an
        uproar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:032<TD><font size=5>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
        unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the
        soldiers, they left beating of Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:033<TD><font size=5>Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
        him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and
        what he had done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:034<TD><font size=5>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
        and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he
        commanded him to be carried into the castle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:035<TD><font size=5>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
        of the soldiers for the violence of the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:036<TD><font size=5>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
        with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:037<TD><font size=5>And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
        chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou
        speak Greek? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:038<TD><font size=5>Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
        uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
        that were murderers? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:039<TD><font size=5>But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in

        suffer me to speak unto the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:040<TD><font size=5>And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
        and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
        made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
        saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>022:001 <TD><font size=5>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make

        them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,) </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:003<TD><font size=5>I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
        Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,

022:004<TD><font size=5>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and

022:005<TD><font size=5>As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the

022:006<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come

        heaven a great light round about me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:007<TD><font size=5>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,

022:008<TD><font size=5>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am

022:011<TD><font size=5>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
        led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into

022:012<TD><font size=5>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a

        every synagogue them that believed on thee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:020<TD><font size=5>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
        standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
        raiment of them that slew him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:021<TD><font size=5>And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
        unto the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:022<TD><font size=5>And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
        their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the
        earth: for it is not fit that he should live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:023<TD><font size=5>And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
        dust into the air, </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:024<TD><font size=5>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
        and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he
        might know wherefore they cried so against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:025<TD><font size=5>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
        centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
        that is a Roman, and uncondemned? </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:026<TD><font size=5>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
        captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
        Roman. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:027<TD><font size=5>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
        thou a Roman? He said, Yea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:028<TD><font size=5>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
        this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:029<TD><font size=5>Then straightway they departed from him which should have
        examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
        knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

022:030<TD><font size=5>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
        wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his
        bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council
        to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>023:001 <TD><font size=5>And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
        brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until
        this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:002<TD><font size=5>And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
        to smite him on the mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:003<TD><font size=5>Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited
        wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and
        commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:004<TD><font size=5>And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:005<TD><font size=5>Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
        priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the
        ruler of thy people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:006<TD><font size=5>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
        the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and
        brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope
        and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:007<TD><font size=5>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
        Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:008<TD><font size=5>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
        angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:009<TD><font size=5>And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
        Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in
        this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
        us not fight against God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:010<TD><font size=5>And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
        fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them,
        commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force
        from among them, and to bring him into the castle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:011<TD><font size=5>And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
        good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in
        Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:012<TD><font size=5>And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
        bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither
        eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:013<TD><font size=5>And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:014<TD><font size=5>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We
        have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat
        nothing until we have slain Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:015<TD><font size=5>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
        that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would
        enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or
        ever he come near, are ready to kill him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:016<TD><font size=5>And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
        went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:017<TD><font size=5>Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said,
        Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
        certain thing to tell him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:018<TD><font size=5>So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and
        said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to
        bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
        thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:019<TD><font size=5>Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
        aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell
        me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:020<TD><font size=5>And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
        wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though
        they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:021<TD><font size=5>But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
        of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with
        an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have
        killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from
        thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:022<TD><font size=5>So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and
        charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these
        things to me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:023<TD><font size=5>And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
        hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore
        and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the
        night; </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:024<TD><font size=5>And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring
        him safe unto Felix the governor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:025<TD><font size=5>And he wrote a letter after this manner: </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:026<TD><font size=5>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
        greeting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:027<TD><font size=5>This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
        them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
        understood that he was a Roman. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:028<TD><font size=5>And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
        him, I brought him forth into their council: </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:029<TD><font size=5>Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but
        to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
        bonds. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:030<TD><font size=5>And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
        man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his
        accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.
        Farewell. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:031<TD><font size=5>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
        brought him by night to Antipatris. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:032<TD><font size=5>On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
        returned to the castle: </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:033<TD><font size=5>Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to
        the governor, presented Paul also before him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:034<TD><font size=5>And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
        province he was. And when he understood that he was of
        Cilicia; </font><TR><td valign=top>

023:035<TD><font size=5>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
        And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>024:001 <TD><font size=5>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
        elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who
        informed the governor against Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:002<TD><font size=5>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
        saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that
        very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:003<TD><font size=5>We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with
        all thankfulness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:004<TD><font size=5>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
        pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
        words. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:005<TD><font size=5>For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
        sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
        ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:006<TD><font size=5>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
        and would have judged according to our law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:007<TD><font size=5>But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
        violence took him away out of our hands, </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:008<TD><font size=5>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
        whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
        whereof we accuse him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:009<TD><font size=5>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:010<TD><font size=5>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
        speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of
        many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
        answer for myself: </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:011<TD><font size=5>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
        twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:012<TD><font size=5>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
        man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues,
        nor in the city: </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:013<TD><font size=5>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:014<TD><font size=5>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
        call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
        things which are written in the law and in the prophets: </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:015<TD><font size=5>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
        that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
        just and unjust. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:016<TD><font size=5>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
        void to offence toward God, and toward men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:017<TD><font size=5>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
        offerings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:018<TD><font size=5>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
        temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:019<TD><font size=5>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
        had ought against me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:020<TD><font size=5>Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
        doing in me, while I stood before the council, </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:021<TD><font size=5>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
        them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in
        question by you this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:022<TD><font size=5>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect
        knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias
        the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost
        of your matter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:023<TD><font size=5>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
        liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
        minister or come unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:024<TD><font size=5>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife
        Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him
        concerning the faith in Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:025<TD><font size=5>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
        to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
        time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:026<TD><font size=5>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
        that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the
        oftener, and communed with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

024:027<TD><font size=5>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
        Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>025:001 <TD><font size=5>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
        he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:002<TD><font size=5>Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
        against Paul, and besought him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:003<TD><font size=5>And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
        Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:004<TD><font size=5>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
        that he himself would depart shortly thither. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:005<TD><font size=5>Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
        with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:006<TD><font size=5>And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
        down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment
        seat commanded Paul to be brought. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:007<TD><font size=5>And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
        stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints
        against Paul, which they could not prove. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:008<TD><font size=5>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
        Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have
        I offended any thing at all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:009<TD><font size=5>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
        and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
        these things before me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:010<TD><font size=5>Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
        ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou
        very well knowest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:011<TD><font size=5>For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
        death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these
        things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto
        them. I appeal unto Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:012<TD><font size=5>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
        Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:013<TD><font size=5>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
        Caesarea to salute Festus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:014<TD><font size=5>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's
        cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in
        bonds by Felix: </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:015<TD><font size=5>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
        elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
        against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:016<TD><font size=5>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
        deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have
        the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for
        himself concerning the crime laid against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:017<TD><font size=5>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on
        the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man
        to be brought forth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:018<TD><font size=5>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
        accusation of such things as I supposed: </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:019<TD><font size=5>But had certain questions against him of their own
        superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul
        affirmed to be alive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:020<TD><font size=5>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
        whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
        matters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:021<TD><font size=5>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
        Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
        Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:022<TD><font size=5>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man
        myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:023<TD><font size=5>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
        great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with
        the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus'
        commandment Paul was brought forth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:024<TD><font size=5>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
        present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude
        of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also
        here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:025<TD><font size=5>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of
        death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have
        determined to send him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:026<TD><font size=5>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
        Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
        before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
        might have somewhat to write. </font><TR><td valign=top>

025:027<TD><font size=5>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
        withal to signify the crimes laid against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>026:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
        thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
        himself: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:002<TD><font size=5>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
        myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I
        am accused of the Jews: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:003<TD><font size=5>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
        questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
        to hear me patiently. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:004<TD><font size=5>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
        mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:005<TD><font size=5>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
        after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a
        Pharisee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:006<TD><font size=5>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
        of God, unto our fathers: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:007<TD><font size=5>Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
        day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king
        Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:008<TD><font size=5>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
        should raise the dead? </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:009<TD><font size=5>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
        contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:010<TD><font size=5>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
        did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
        chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
        voice against them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:011<TD><font size=5>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
        to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
        persecuted them even unto strange cities. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:012<TD><font size=5>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
        from the chief priests, </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:013<TD><font size=5>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
        the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them
        which journeyed with me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:014<TD><font size=5>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
        speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
        why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
        the pricks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:015<TD><font size=5>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
        thou persecutest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:016<TD><font size=5>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
        thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
        both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
        in the which I will appear unto thee; </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:017<TD><font size=5>Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
        whom now I send thee, </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:018<TD><font size=5>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
        and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
        forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
        sanctified by faith that is in me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:019<TD><font size=5>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
        heavenly vision: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:020<TD><font size=5>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
        throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
        that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
        repentance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:021<TD><font size=5>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
        about to kill me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:022<TD><font size=5>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
        day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other
        things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
        come: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:023<TD><font size=5>That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
        that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
        people, and to the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:024<TD><font size=5>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
        voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make
        thee mad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:025<TD><font size=5>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
        the words of truth and soberness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:026<TD><font size=5>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
        freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are
        hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:027<TD><font size=5>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
        believest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:028<TD><font size=5>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
        Christian. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:029<TD><font size=5>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
        all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether
        such as I am, except these bonds. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:030<TD><font size=5>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
        governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:031<TD><font size=5>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
        saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:032<TD><font size=5>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
        liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>027:001 <TD><font size=5>And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
        they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named
        Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:002<TD><font size=5>And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
        to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian
        of Thessalonica, being with us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:003<TD><font size=5>And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
        entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to
        refresh himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:004<TD><font size=5>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
        because the winds were contrary. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:005<TD><font size=5>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
        we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:006<TD><font size=5>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
        into Italy; and he put us therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:007<TD><font size=5>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
        over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed
        under Crete, over against Salmone; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:008<TD><font size=5>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
        fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:009<TD><font size=5>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now
        dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul
        admonished them, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:010<TD><font size=5>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be
        with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,
        but also of our lives. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:011<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner
        of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:012<TD><font size=5>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
        more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
        might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an
        haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north
        west. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:013<TD><font size=5>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
        obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by
        Crete. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:014<TD><font size=5>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
        called Euroclydon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:015<TD><font size=5>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
        wind, we let her drive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:016<TD><font size=5>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
        had much work to come by the boat: </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:017<TD><font size=5>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
        the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the
        quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:018<TD><font size=5>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
        they lightened the ship; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:019<TD><font size=5>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling
        of the ship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:020<TD><font size=5>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
        small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was
        then taken away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:021<TD><font size=5>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
        them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and
        not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and
        loss. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:022<TD><font size=5>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be
        no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:023<TD><font size=5>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
        and whom I serve, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:024<TD><font size=5>Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:
        and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:025<TD><font size=5>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
        shall be even as it was told me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:026<TD><font size=5>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:027<TD><font size=5>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up
        and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they
        drew near to some country; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:028<TD><font size=5>And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had
        gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
        fifteen fathoms. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:029<TD><font size=5>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
        four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:030<TD><font size=5>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
        they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as
        though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:031<TD><font size=5>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
        abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:032<TD><font size=5>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
        fall off. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:033<TD><font size=5>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
        take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
        tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:034<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
        health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any
        of you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:035<TD><font size=5>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
        God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he
        began to eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:036<TD><font size=5>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
        meat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:037<TD><font size=5>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
        sixteen souls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:038<TD><font size=5>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
        cast out the wheat into the sea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:039<TD><font size=5>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
        discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they
        were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:040<TD><font size=5>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
        themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
        hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:041<TD><font size=5>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
        aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
        but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:042<TD><font size=5>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any
        of them should swim out, and escape. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:043<TD><font size=5>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
        purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
        themselves first into the sea, and get to land: </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:044<TD><font size=5>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the
        ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
        land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>028:001 <TD><font size=5>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
        called Melita. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:002<TD><font size=5>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
        they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
        present rain, and because of the cold. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:003<TD><font size=5>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them
        on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened
        on his hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:004<TD><font size=5>And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his
        hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
        murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
        suffereth not to live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:005<TD><font size=5>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:006<TD><font size=5>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
        down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while,
        and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and
        said that he was a god. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:007<TD><font size=5>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
        island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
        three days courteously. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:008<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
        fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and
        prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:009<TD><font size=5>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
        island, came, and were healed: </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:010<TD><font size=5>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
        they laded us with such things as were necessary. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:011<TD><font size=5>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
        which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and
        Pollux. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:012<TD><font size=5>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:013<TD><font size=5>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
        after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
        Puteoli: </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:014<TD><font size=5>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
        seven days: and so we went toward Rome. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:015<TD><font size=5>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
        meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
        when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:016<TD><font size=5>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
        prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered
        to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:017<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
        chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
        he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
        nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
        I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
        Romans. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:018<TD><font size=5>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
        there was no cause of death in me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:019<TD><font size=5>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to
        appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation
        of. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:020<TD><font size=5>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
        and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
        am bound with this chain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:021<TD><font size=5>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
        Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
        shewed or spake any harm of thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:022<TD><font size=5>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
        concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
        against. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:023<TD><font size=5>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
        into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
        kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
        the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
        evening. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:024<TD><font size=5>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
        believed not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:025<TD><font size=5>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
        after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
        by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:026<TD><font size=5>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
        and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
        perceive: </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:027<TD><font size=5>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
        are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
        they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
        understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
        should heal them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:028<TD><font size=5>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
        sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:029<TD><font size=5>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
        great reasoning among themselves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:030<TD><font size=5>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
        received all that came in unto him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

028:031<TD><font size=5>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
        concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
        forbidding him.</font>
