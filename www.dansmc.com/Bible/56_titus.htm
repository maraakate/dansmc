<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
        of the truth which is after godliness; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
        before the world began; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
        which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
        our Saviour; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
        and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
        Saviour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
        in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
        every city, as I had appointed thee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
        children not accused of riot or unruly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
        selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
        given to filthy lucre; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
        holy, temperate; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
        may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
        the gainsayers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
        specially they of the circumcision: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
        teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
        Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
        may be sound in the faith; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
        that turn from the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
        defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
        and conscience is defiled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
        being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
        reprobate. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
        in charity, in patience. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
        holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
        of good things; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
        husbands, to love their children, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
        their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
        doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
        contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
        you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
        please them well in all things; not answering again; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
        adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
        all men, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
        should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
        world; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
        the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
        iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
        of good works. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
        Let no man despise thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
        to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
        shewing all meekness unto all men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
        deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
        and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
        man appeared, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
        according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
        Saviour; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
        according to the hope of eternal life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
        affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
        be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
        profitable unto men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
        and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
        vain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>A man that is an heretick after the first and second
        admonition reject; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
        condemned of himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
        to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
        winter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
        diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
        uses, that they be not unfruitful. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
        the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</font>
