001:001 <TD><font size=5>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
        the son of Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
        Judas and his brethren; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
        Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
        Naasson begat Salmon; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
        and Obed begat Jesse; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
        Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
        begat Asa; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
        begat Ozias; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
        begat Ezekias; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
        begat Josias; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
        they were carried away to Babylon: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
        Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
        Eliakim begat Azor; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
        Eliud; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
        Matthan begat Jacob; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
        Jesus, who is called Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
        generations; and from David until the carrying away into
        Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
        into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
        mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
        she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
        make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
        privily. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
        LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
        David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
        which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
        JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
        son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
        interpreted is, God with us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
        Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
        and he called his name JESUS. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
        Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
        Jerusalem, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
        seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
        and all Jerusalem with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
        the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
        be born. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
        written by the prophet, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
        among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
        Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
        of them diligently what time the star appeared. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
        diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
        bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
        star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
        came and stood over where the young child was. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
        joy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
        child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
        and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
        him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
        to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
        appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
        young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
        there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
        child to destroy him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
        night, and departed into Egypt: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
        Out of Egypt have I called my son. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
        was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
        that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
        two years old and under, according to the time which he had
        diligently enquired of the wise men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
        great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
        be comforted, because they are not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
        appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
        into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
        young child's life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
        came into the land of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
        room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
        notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
        aside into the parts of Galilee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
        be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
        called a Nazarene. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
        wilderness of Judaea, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
        saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
        the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
        leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
        wild honey. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
        region round about Jordan, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
        his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
        hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
        father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
        to raise up children unto Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
        therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
        hewn down, and cast into the fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
        cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
        worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
        with fire: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
        up the chaff with unquenchable fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
        baptized of him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
        thee, and comest thou to me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
        thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
        suffered him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
        the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
        saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
        upon him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
        tempted of the devil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
        afterward an hungred. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
        of God, command that these stones be made bread. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
        mouth of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
        him on a pinnacle of the temple, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
        down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
        concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
        lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
        the Lord thy God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
        mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
        the glory of them; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
        wilt fall down and worship me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
        written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
        shalt thou serve. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
        ministered unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
        departed into Galilee; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
        upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
        the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
        which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
        up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
        the kingdom of heaven is at hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
        Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
        the sea: for they were fishers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
        of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
        their father, mending their nets; and he called them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
        followed him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
        synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
        the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
        him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
        torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
        those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
        he healed them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:025<TD><font size=5>And there followed him great multitudes of people from
        Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
        Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
        when he was set, his disciples came unto him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
        heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
        righteousness: for they shall be filled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
        children of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
        and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
        sake. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
        heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
        you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
        savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
        for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
        of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
        cannot be hid. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
        on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
        house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
        good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
        I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
        fulfilled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
        commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the

        teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
        heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
        exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
        shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
        not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
        judgment: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
        without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
        whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
        of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
        in danger of hell fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        the wheat into my barn. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:031<TD><font size=5>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of

013:032<TD><font size=5>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,

013:033<TD><font size=5>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is

        field. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:044<TD><font size=5>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
        time, saying the same words. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:045<TD><font size=5>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
        now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the
        Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:046<TD><font size=5>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
        me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:047<TD><font size=5>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
        and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
        the chief priests and elders of the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:048<TD><font size=5>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
        I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:049<TD><font size=5>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
        kissed him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:050<TD><font size=5>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
        came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:051<TD><font size=5>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
        his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
        priest's, and smote off his ear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:052<TD><font size=5>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
        place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
        sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:053<TD><font size=5>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
        shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:054<TD><font size=5>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
        must be? </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:055<TD><font size=5>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
        out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
        I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
        hold on me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:056<TD><font size=5>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
        might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
        fled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:057<TD><font size=5>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
        the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
        assembled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:058<TD><font size=5>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
        and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:059<TD><font size=5>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
        false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:060<TD><font size=5>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
        found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:061<TD><font size=5>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
        God, and to build it in three days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:062<TD><font size=5>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
        nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:063<TD><font size=5>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and
        said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
        us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:064<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
        you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
        right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:065<TD><font size=5>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
        blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now
        ye have heard his blasphemy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:066<TD><font size=5>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:067<TD><font size=5>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
        smote him with the palms of their hands, </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:068<TD><font size=5>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
        thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:069<TD><font size=5>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
        him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:070<TD><font size=5>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
        sayest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:071<TD><font size=5>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
        and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with
        Jesus of Nazareth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:072<TD><font size=5>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:073<TD><font size=5>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said
        to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
        bewrayeth thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:074<TD><font size=5>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
        man. And immediately the cock crew. </font><TR><td valign=top>

026:075<TD><font size=5>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
        Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
        out, and wept bitterly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>027:001 <TD><font size=5>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
        the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:002<TD><font size=5>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
        him to Pontius Pilate the governor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:003<TD><font size=5>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
        condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty
        pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:004<TD><font size=5>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
        blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:005<TD><font size=5>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
        departed, and went and hanged himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:006<TD><font size=5>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
        not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
        the price of blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:007<TD><font size=5>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
        field, to bury strangers in. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:008<TD><font size=5>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
        day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:009<TD><font size=5>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
        the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
        Israel did value; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:010<TD><font size=5>And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
        me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:011<TD><font size=5>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
        him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
        unto him, Thou sayest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:012<TD><font size=5>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
        answered nothing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:013<TD><font size=5>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
        they witness against thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:014<TD><font size=5>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
        governor marvelled greatly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:015<TD><font size=5>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
        people a prisoner, whom they would. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:016<TD><font size=5>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:017<TD><font size=5>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
        them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
        which is called Christ? </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:018<TD><font size=5>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:019<TD><font size=5>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
        him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
        have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:020<TD><font size=5>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
        they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:021<TD><font size=5>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
        will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:022<TD><font size=5>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
        is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:023<TD><font size=5>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
        cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:024<TD><font size=5>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
        a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
        the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
        person: see ye to it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:025<TD><font size=5>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,
        and on our children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:026<TD><font size=5>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
        Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:027<TD><font size=5>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
        hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:028<TD><font size=5>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:029<TD><font size=5>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
        his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
        knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
        Jews! </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:030<TD><font size=5>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
        the head. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:031<TD><font size=5>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
        from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
        crucify him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:032<TD><font size=5>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
        name: him they compelled to bear his cross. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:033<TD><font size=5>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is
        to say, a place of a skull, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:034<TD><font size=5>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
        had tasted thereof, he would not drink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:035<TD><font size=5>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
        that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
        they cast lots. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:036<TD><font size=5>And sitting down they watched him there; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:037<TD><font size=5>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
        THE KING OF THE JEWS. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:038<TD><font size=5>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
        right hand, and another on the left. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:039<TD><font size=5>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:040<TD><font size=5>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it
        in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
        down from the cross. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:041<TD><font size=5>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
        and elders, said, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:042<TD><font size=5>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
        Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
        believe him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:043<TD><font size=5>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
        him: for he said, I am the Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:044<TD><font size=5>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
        in his teeth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:045<TD><font size=5>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
        unto the ninth hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:046<TD><font size=5>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
        saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
        God, why hast thou forsaken me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:047<TD><font size=5>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,
        This man calleth for Elias. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:048<TD><font size=5>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
        it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:049<TD><font size=5>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
        save him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:050<TD><font size=5>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
        the ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:051<TD><font size=5>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
        top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
        rent; </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:052<TD><font size=5>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
        which slept arose, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:053<TD><font size=5>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
        into the holy city, and appeared unto many. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:054<TD><font size=5>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
        Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,
        they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:055<TD><font size=5>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
        Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:056<TD><font size=5>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
        and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:057<TD><font size=5>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
        named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:058<TD><font size=5>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
        commanded the body to be delivered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:059<TD><font size=5>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
        linen cloth, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:060<TD><font size=5>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
        rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
        sepulchre, and departed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:061<TD><font size=5>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
        against the sepulchre. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:062<TD><font size=5>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
        the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:063<TD><font size=5>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was
        yet alive, After three days I will rise again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:064<TD><font size=5>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
        third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him

        the last error shall be worse than the first. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:065<TD><font size=5>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
        as sure as ye can. </font><TR><td valign=top>

027:066<TD><font size=5>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,

028:012<TD><font size=5>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
