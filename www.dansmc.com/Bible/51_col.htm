001:003<TD><font size=5>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

001:004<TD><font size=5>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
        which ye have to all the saints, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
        heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and
        bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye
        heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is
        for you a faithful minister of Christ; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not

        understanding; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being

001:012<TD><font size=5>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
        partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
        translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
        forgiveness of sins: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
        creature: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
        that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
        thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
        things were created by him, and for him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
        beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
        might have the preeminence. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness
        dwell; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him
        to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether
        they be things in earth, or things in heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind
        by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy
        and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
        moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,

        heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
        which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
        his body's sake, which is the church: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of
        God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
        generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
        of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
        the hope of glory: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in
        all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ
        Jesus: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working,
        which worketh in me mightily. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,

        face in the flesh; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
        love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of

        and of the Father, and of Christ; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
        words. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
        spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness
        of your faith in Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
        ye in him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye
        have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
        deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
        world, and not after Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all
        principality and power: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
        without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the
        flesh by the circumcision of Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
        through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him
        from the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
        your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having
        forgiven you all trespasses; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
        us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
        nailing it to his cross; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
        of them openly, triumphing over them in it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
        respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
        days: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility
        and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which
        he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints
        and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together,
        increaseth with the increase of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the

        ordinances, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>(Touch not; taste not; handle not; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the
        commandments and doctrines of men? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
        humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the
        satisfying of the flesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
        blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>
