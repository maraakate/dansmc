001:001 <TD><font size=5>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
        is she become as a widow! she that was great among the
        nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become
        tributary! </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her
        cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all
        her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become
        her enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and
        because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen,
        she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between
        the straits. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
        feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her
        virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
        LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
        transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before
        the enemy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
        princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they
        are gone without strength before the pursuer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
        miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of
        old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
        did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her
        sabbaths. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
        all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
        nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
        end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
        comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
        magnified himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
        things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her
        sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter
        into thy congregation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
        pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
        consider; for I am become vile. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
        there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
        me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his
        fierce anger. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
        against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned
        me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
        wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength
        to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from
        whom I am not able to rise up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the
        midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
        young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
        Judah, as in a winepress. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
        water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is
        far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy
        prevailed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort
        her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his
        adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a
        menstruous woman among them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
        commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my
        sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and
        mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
        their meat to relieve their souls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
        mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
        rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as
        death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
        mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou
        hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
        and they shall be like unto me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
        as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my
        sighs are many, and my heart is faint. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
        his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty
        of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his
        anger! </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
        hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
        holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to
        the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes
        thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
        hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
        burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth
        round about. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
        hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the
        eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out
        his fury like fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
        swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong
        holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning
        and lamentation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
        of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
        LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be
        forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
        anger the king and the priest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
        sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
        walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of
        the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
        Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
        hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the
        wall to lament; they languished together. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
        broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the
        Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision
        from the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
        keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
        have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of
        Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver
        is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in
        the streets of the city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
        swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their
        soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
        I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal
        to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
        for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
        they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
        captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
        banishment. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag
        their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the
        city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the
        whole earth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
        hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
        certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,
        we have seen it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath
        fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
        he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
        thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of
        thine adversaries. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of
        Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give
        thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
        pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD:
        lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
        children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
        Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?
        shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of
        the Lord? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
        virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast
        slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and
        not pitied. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
        that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained:
        those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy
        consumed. </font><TR><td valign=top>
