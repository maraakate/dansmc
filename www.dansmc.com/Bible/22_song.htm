        better than wine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
        ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
        remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
        tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
        looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
        made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
        have I not kept. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
        thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
        one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
        by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
        shepherds' tents. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
        Pharaoh's chariots. </font><TR><td valign=top>
