<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
        children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
        us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
        my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
        likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
        the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
        him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
        him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
        thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
        brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
        had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
        set the city on fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
        and in the valley. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
        Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
        the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
        it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
        ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
        me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
        her the upper springs and the nether springs. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
        the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
        they went and dwelt among the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
        Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        And the name of the city was called Hormah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
        the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
        of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
        the valley, because they had chariots of iron. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
        expelled thence the three sons of Anak. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
        that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
        children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
        the LORD was with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
        city, and we will shew thee mercy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
        and all his family. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
        city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
        thereof unto this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
        towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
        Canaanites would dwell in that land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
        Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
        Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:030<TD><font size=5>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
        the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
        them, and became tributaries. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:031<TD><font size=5>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
        inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
        Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:032<TD><font size=5>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land: for they did not drive them out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:033<TD><font size=5>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
        Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
        inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
        unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:034<TD><font size=5>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
        for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:035<TD><font size=5>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
        Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
        that they became tributaries. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:036<TD><font size=5>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
        Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
        said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
        unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
        will never break my covenant with you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
        ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
        voice: why have ye done this? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
        you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
        words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
        sacrificed there unto the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
        went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
        the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
        being an hundred and ten years old. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill Gaash. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
        the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and served Baalim: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
        gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
        themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
        them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
        unto them: and they were greatly distressed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
        out of the hand of those that spoiled them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
        went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
        them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
        walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
        not so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
        enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
        because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
        them and vexed them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
        returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
        following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
        they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
        way. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
        Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
        the nations which Joshua left when he died: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
        it, or not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
        out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
        Joshua. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
        of Canaan; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
        know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
        nothing thereof; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
        Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
        commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
        Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
        Jebusites: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
        groves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
        Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
        Chushanrishathaim eight years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
        them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
        Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
        Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
        hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
        Kenaz died. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
        Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
        went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
        eighteen years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
        a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
        present unto Eglon the king of Moab. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
        length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
        thigh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
        was a very fat man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
        the people that bare the present. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
        Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
        who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
        from him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
        parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
        a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
        his belly; and the dirt came out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
        the parlour upon him, and locked them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
        that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
        Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
        opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
        key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
        dead on the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
        quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:027<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
        in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the mount, and he before them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:028<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
        delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
        went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
        and suffered not a man to pass over. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:029<TD><font size=5>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
        lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:030<TD><font size=5>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
        land had rest fourscore years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:031<TD><font size=5>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
        Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
        delivered Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
        LORD, when Ehud was dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
        which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
        nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
        oppressed the children of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
        Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
        her for judgment. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
        Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
        take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
        captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into thine hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
        go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
        journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
        the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
        Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
        up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with

004:011<TD><font size=5>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
        father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
        and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
        Kedesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
        up to mount Tabor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
        hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
        him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
        the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
        LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
        Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
        his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
        Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
        feet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
        Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
        upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the

        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
        my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
        unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
        drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
        gave him drink, and covered him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
        shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
        Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
        hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
        nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
        was fast asleep and weary. So he died. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
        him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
        whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
        Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the

007:011<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
        hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
        down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
        that were in the host. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:012<TD><font size=5>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
        multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
        by the sea side for multitude. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:013<TD><font size=5>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
        dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
        and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
        Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
        overturned it, that the tent lay along. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:014<TD><font size=5>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
        the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
        into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:015<TD><font size=5>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
        the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
        into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
        delivered into your hand the host of Midian. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:016<TD><font size=5>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
        he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
        lamps within the pitchers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:017<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
        behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
        that, as I do, so shall ye do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:018<TD><font size=5>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
        blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
        say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:019<TD><font size=5>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
        the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
        and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
        trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:020<TD><font size=5>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
        pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
        trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
        The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:021<TD><font size=5>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the host ran, and cried, and fled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:022<TD><font size=5>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
        every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
        host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
        border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:023<TD><font size=5>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
        Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
        pursued after the Midianites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:024<TD><font size=5>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
        saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
        the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
        Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
        Bethbarah and Jordan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:025<TD><font size=5>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
        the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
        heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>008:001 <TD><font size=5>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us

        with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:002<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
        you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer? </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:003<TD><font size=5>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
        their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:004<TD><font size=5>And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:005<TD><font size=5>And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
        of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
        and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:006<TD><font size=5>And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
        Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
        thine army? </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:007<TD><font size=5>And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
        and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
        the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:008<TD><font size=5>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
        answered him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:009<TD><font size=5>And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
        again in peace, I will break down this tower. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:010<TD><font size=5>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
        them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
        the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
        hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:011<TD><font size=5>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
        the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
        host was secure. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:012<TD><font size=5>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
        took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
        discomfited all the host. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:013<TD><font size=5>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
        sun was up, </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:014<TD><font size=5>And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
        him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
        elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:015<TD><font size=5>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
        and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
        hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
        give bread unto thy men that are weary? </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:016<TD><font size=5>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
        wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
        Succoth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:017<TD><font size=5>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
        city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:018<TD><font size=5>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
        were they; each one resembled the children of a king. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:019<TD><font size=5>And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
        mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
        would not slay you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:020<TD><font size=5>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
        the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
        yet a youth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:021<TD><font size=5>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
        as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
        Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
        their camels' necks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:022<TD><font size=5>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
        both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
        delivered us from the hand of Midian. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:023<TD><font size=5>And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
        shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:024<TD><font size=5>And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
        that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
        they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:025<TD><font size=5>And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
        spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
        of his prey. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:026<TD><font size=5>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
        thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
        and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
        Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
        necks. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:027<TD><font size=5>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
        in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
        which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:028<TD><font size=5>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
        they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
        quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:029<TD><font size=5>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
        house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:030<TD><font size=5>And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:

008:031<TD><font size=5>And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a

008:032<TD><font size=5>And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was

008:033<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
        children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
        Baalim, and made Baalberith their god. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:034<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,

008:035<TD><font size=5>Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,

        unto the woman let her beware. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:014<TD><font size=5>She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
        let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
        all that I commanded her let her observe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:015<TD><font size=5>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
        us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:016<TD><font size=5>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
        me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
        burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
        knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:017<TD><font size=5>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
        that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:018<TD><font size=5>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
        after my name, seeing it is secret? </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:019<TD><font size=5>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
        a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
        Manoah and his wife looked on. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:020<TD><font size=5>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
        off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
        flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
        fell on their faces to the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:021<TD><font size=5>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
        his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:022<TD><font size=5>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:023<TD><font size=5>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
        us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
        offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
        these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
        things as these. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:024<TD><font size=5>And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
        child grew, and the LORD blessed him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

013:025<TD><font size=5>And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the

        I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
        Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:003<TD><font size=5>Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
        woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
        people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
        Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
        for she pleaseth me well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:004<TD><font size=5>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
        LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
        at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:005<TD><font size=5>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
        Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
        young lion roared against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:006<TD><font size=5>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
        him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his

        done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:007<TD><font size=5>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
        Samson well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:008<TD><font size=5>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
        to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm

014:009<TD><font size=5>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came

        carcase of the lion. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:010<TD><font size=5>So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there

014:014<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and

        fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so? </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:016<TD><font size=5>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
        hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
        the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
        said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my

014:017<TD><font size=5>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast

014:018<TD><font size=5>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day

014:019<TD><font size=5>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to

        father's house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:002<TD><font size=5>And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly

020:025<TD><font size=5>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
        day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
        Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:026<TD><font size=5>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
        the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:027<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
        of the covenant of God was there in those days, </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:028<TD><font size=5>And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
        before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
        battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
        cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
        them into thine hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:029<TD><font size=5>And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:030<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel went up against the children of
        Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
        Gibeah, as at other times. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:031<TD><font size=5>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
        were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
        people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
        one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
        the field, about thirty men of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:032<TD><font size=5>And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
        before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
        Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:033<TD><font size=5>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
        themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
        Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
        of Gibeah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:034<TD><font size=5>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
        all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
        evil was near them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:035<TD><font size=5>And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
        Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
        thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:036<TD><font size=5>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
        the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
        trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
        Gibeah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:037<TD><font size=5>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
        liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
        with the edge of the sword. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:038<TD><font size=5>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
        the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
        smoke rise up out of the city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:039<TD><font size=5>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
        began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
        persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
        us, as in the first battle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:040<TD><font size=5>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
        pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
        behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:041<TD><font size=5>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
        were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:042<TD><font size=5>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
        and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
        midst of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:043<TD><font size=5>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
        them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
        the sunrising. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:044<TD><font size=5>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
        were men of valour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:045<TD><font size=5>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
        of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
        thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
        two thousand men of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:046<TD><font size=5>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
        five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
        valour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:047<TD><font size=5>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
        rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. </font><TR><td valign=top>

020:048<TD><font size=5>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
        Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
        the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
        hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>021:001 <TD><font size=5>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:002<TD><font size=5>And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
        even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:003<TD><font size=5>And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
        Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
        Israel? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:004<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
        peace offerings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:005<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
        tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
        the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
        came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
        put to death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:006<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
        brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
        day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:007<TD><font size=5>How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
        sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
        to wives? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:008<TD><font size=5>And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
        came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
        none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:009<TD><font size=5>For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
        the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:010<TD><font size=5>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
        valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
        inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
        the women and the children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:011<TD><font size=5>And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
        destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:012<TD><font size=5>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
        hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
        male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
        in the land of Canaan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:013<TD><font size=5>And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
        of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
        peaceably unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:014<TD><font size=5>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
        which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
        yet so they sufficed them not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:015<TD><font size=5>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
        LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:016<TD><font size=5>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
        of Benjamin? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:017<TD><font size=5>And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
        escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
        Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:018<TD><font size=5>Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
        children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
        giveth a wife to Benjamin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:019<TD><font size=5>Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
        yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
        east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:020<TD><font size=5>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
        and lie in wait in the vineyards; </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:021<TD><font size=5>And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
        dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
        you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
        the land of Benjamin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:022<TD><font size=5>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
        unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
        unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
        his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
        time, that ye should be guilty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:023<TD><font size=5>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
        according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
        caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
        repaired the cities, and dwelt in them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:024<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
        man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
        thence every man to his inheritance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:025<TD><font size=5>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
        which was right in his own eyes.</font>
