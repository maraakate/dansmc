        flesh, and ye shall eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:012<TD><font size=5>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:013<TD><font size=5>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
        Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
        coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:014<TD><font size=5>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
        he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:015<TD><font size=5>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
        dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:016<TD><font size=5>And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
        the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
        will give them water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:017<TD><font size=5>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
        it: </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:018<TD><font size=5>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
        it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
        from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:019<TD><font size=5>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:020<TD><font size=5>And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:021<TD><font size=5>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:022<TD><font size=5>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
        fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
        of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
        until we be past thy borders. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:023<TD><font size=5>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
        fought against Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:024<TD><font size=5>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
        his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
        Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:025<TD><font size=5>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
        cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
        thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:026<TD><font size=5>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,

        his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:027<TD><font size=5>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
        let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:028<TD><font size=5>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
        of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
        high places of Arnon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:029<TD><font size=5>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
        hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
        captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:030<TD><font size=5>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
        we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
        Medeba. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:031<TD><font size=5>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:032<TD><font size=5>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages

021:033<TD><font size=5>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the

        to the battle at Edrei. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:034<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
        delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;

        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:035<TD><font size=5>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until

022:026<TD><font size=5>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow

022:028<TD><font size=5>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
