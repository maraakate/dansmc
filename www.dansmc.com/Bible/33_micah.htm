<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
        days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
        saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
        is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from
        his holy temple. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
        come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
        shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
        are poured down a steep place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
        it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
        they not Jerusalem? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
        plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
        thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
        thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
        and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
        all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it
        of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of
        an harlot. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
        I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the
        owls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is
        come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
        Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
        naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning
        of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
        evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
        beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
        Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the
        houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
        he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;
        enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
        captivity from thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
        beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
        is in the power of their hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
        and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
        a man and his heritage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do
        I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
        neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
        lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly
        spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
        removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
        in the congregation of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
        not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the
        LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good
        to him that walketh uprightly? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
        the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
        men averse from war. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
        houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for
        ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
        polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I
        will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
        even be the prophet of this people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
        gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
        sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
        shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
        have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and
        their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of
        them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
        of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
        from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
        he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they
        have behaved themselves ill in their doings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my
        people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
        that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war
        against him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
        vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not
        divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the
        day shall be dark over them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
        yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
        of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
        judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
        transgression, and to Israel his sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
        princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and
        pervert all equity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
        teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
        will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among
        us? none evil can come upon us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
        Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as
        the high places of the forest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
        of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
        the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
        people shall flow unto it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
        to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
        Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
        his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
        nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
        plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
        not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn
        war any more. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
        tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the
        LORD of hosts hath spoken it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and
        we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
        ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
        and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
        afflicted; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was
        cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
        them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the
        daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first
        dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is
        thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman
        in travail. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
        like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of
        the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
        even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD
        shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let
        her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
        they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into
        the floor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
        horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt
        beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain
        unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
        earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
        laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel

005:002<TD><font size=5>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
        thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
        me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
        from of old, from everlasting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
        travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
        brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        destroy thy chariots: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all
