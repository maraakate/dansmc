<center><h3>Book 35</h3><h1>HABAKKUK</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
        out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
        grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
        are that raise up strife and contention. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
        forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
        therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
        marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
        not believe, though it be told you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
        nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
        possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
        dignity shall proceed of themselves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
        fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
        spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
        they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
        the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
        sand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
        scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
        shall heap dust, and take it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
        offend, imputing this his power unto his god. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
        we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
        judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
        correction. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
        on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
        treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
        devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
        things, that have no ruler over them? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
        their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
        rejoice and are glad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
        their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
        meat plenteous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
        continually to slay the nations? </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
        will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
        answer when I am reproved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
        it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
        shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
        because it will surely come, it will not tarry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
        the just shall live by his faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
        neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
        is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
        all nations, and heapeth unto him all people: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
        taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
        increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
        ladeth himself with thick clay! </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
        awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
        them? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
        people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
        violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
        therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
        that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
        from the power of evil! </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
        people, and hast sinned against thy soul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
        the timber shall answer it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
        city by iniquity! </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
        labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
        for very vanity? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
        of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
        bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
        look on their nakedness! </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
        thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
        shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
        thy glory. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
        beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
        for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
        dwell therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
        graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
        maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
        Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
        silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
        silence before him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
        revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
        years make known; in wrath remember mercy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
        His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
        praise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
        of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
        at his feet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
        the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
        perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
        the land of Midian did tremble. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
        against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
        didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
        tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
        rivers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
        the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
        his hands on high. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
        of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
        glittering spear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
        thresh the heathen in anger. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
        salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
        the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
        the neck. Selah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
        villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
        rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
        heap of great waters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
        voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
        myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
        cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
        troops. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
        be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
        fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
        the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
        salvation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
        hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
        places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</font>
