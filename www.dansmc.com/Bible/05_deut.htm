001:001 <TD><font size=5>These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
        side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
        Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
        and Dizahab. </font><TR></font><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
        Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
        month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
        the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
        given him in commandment unto them; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
        in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
        in Edrei: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
        declare this law, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
        long enough in this mount: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
        Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
        plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
        the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
        land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
        and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
        bear you myself alone: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
        this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
        many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
        tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
        is good for us to do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
        made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
        captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
        captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
        causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
        every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
        the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
        face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
        too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
        should do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
        great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
        mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadeshbarnea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
        Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
        and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
        thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
        send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
        bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
        cities we shall come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
        one of a tribe: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
        the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
        brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
        commandment of the LORD your God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
        hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
        heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
        cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
        seen the sons of the Anakims there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:030<TD><font size=5>The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
        you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
        eyes; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:031<TD><font size=5>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
        thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
        that ye went, until ye came into this place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:032<TD><font size=5>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:033<TD><font size=5>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
        pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
        ye should go, and in a cloud by day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:034<TD><font size=5>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
        sware, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:035<TD><font size=5>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
        generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
        fathers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:036<TD><font size=5>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
        will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
        children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:037<TD><font size=5>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
        also shalt not go in thither. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:038<TD><font size=5>But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
        shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
        to inherit it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:039<TD><font size=5>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
        your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
        and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
        it, and they shall possess it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:040<TD><font size=5>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
        wilderness by the way of the Red sea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:041<TD><font size=5>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
        LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
        our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
        weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:042<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
        fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
        enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:043<TD><font size=5>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
        against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
        up into the hill. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:044<TD><font size=5>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
        against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
        Seir, even unto Hormah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:045<TD><font size=5>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
        not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:046<TD><font size=5>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
        ye abode there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
        compassed mount Seir many days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD spake unto me, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
        northward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
        the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
        in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
        unto yourselves therefore: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
        Seir unto Esau for a possession. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
        shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
        hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
        hast lacked nothing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
        which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
        and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
        wilderness of Moab. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
        contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
        land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
        children of Lot for a possession. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
        many, and tall, as the Anakims; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
        Moabites called them Emims. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
        Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
        them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
        his possession, which the LORD gave unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
        went over the brook Zered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
        from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
        them from among the host, until they were consumed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
        dead from among the people, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>That the LORD spake unto me, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
        distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
        thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
        because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
        possession. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
        therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
        LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
        dwelt in their stead: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
        he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
        them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
        Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and dwelt in their stead.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
        behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
        of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
        thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
        shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
        anguish because of thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
        Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:027<TD><font size=5>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
        I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:028<TD><font size=5>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
        my feet; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:029<TD><font size=5>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
        Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:030<TD><font size=5>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
        the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
        obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
        appeareth this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:031<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
        and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
        inherit his land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:032<TD><font size=5>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
        fight at Jahaz. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:033<TD><font size=5>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
        him, and his sons, and all his people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:034<TD><font size=5>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
        left none to remain: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:035<TD><font size=5>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
        spoil of the cities which we took. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:036<TD><font size=5>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
        from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
        was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
        all unto us: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:037<TD><font size=5>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
        nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
        the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
        battle at Edrei. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
        him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
        shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
        left to him remaining. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
        which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
        of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
        beside unwalled towns a great many. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
        Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
        every city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
        prey to ourselves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
        the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
        river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
        it Shenir;) </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
        behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
        Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
        thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
        a man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
        which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
        cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
        Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
        Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
        the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
        own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And I gave Gilead unto Machir. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
        Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
        border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
        children of Ammon; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
        Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
        under Ashdothpisgah eastward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:028<TD><font size=5>For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
        understanding in them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:029<TD><font size=5>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end! </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:030<TD><font size=5>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
        flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
        them up? </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:031<TD><font size=5>For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
        being judges. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:032<TD><font size=5>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
        Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
        bitter: </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:033<TD><font size=5>Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
        asps. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:034<TD><font size=5>Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
        treasures? </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:035<TD><font size=5>To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
        slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
        and the things that shall come upon them make haste. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:036<TD><font size=5>For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
        his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
        there is none shut up, or left. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:037<TD><font size=5>And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
        they trusted, </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:038<TD><font size=5>Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
        of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
        be your protection. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:039<TD><font size=5>See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
        kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
        any that can deliver out of my hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:040<TD><font size=5>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:041<TD><font size=5>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
        judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
        reward them that hate me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:042<TD><font size=5>I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
        devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
        captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:043<TD><font size=5>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the

        people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:044<TD><font size=5>And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the

032:048<TD><font size=5>And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:049<TD><font size=5>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
        is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and

        Israel for a possession: </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:050<TD><font size=5>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered

        was gathered unto his people: </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:051<TD><font size=5>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
        at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
        because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
        Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:052<TD><font size=5>Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go

033:004<TD><font size=5>Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the

        his enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

033:008<TD><font size=5>And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy

        didst strive at the waters of Meribah; </font><TR><td valign=top>

033:009<TD><font size=5>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen

        covenant. </font><TR><td valign=top>

033:010<TD><font size=5>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they

033:012<TD><font size=5>And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell

033:013<TD><font size=5>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for

        head of him that was separated from his brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

033:017<TD><font size=5>His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns

        thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

033:018<TD><font size=5>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;

033:019<TD><font size=5>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall

033:021<TD><font size=5>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
