001:003<TD><font size=5>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye

001:004<TD><font size=5>And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>This then is the message which we have heard of him, and

001:008<TD><font size=5>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the

001:009<TD><font size=5>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
        our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin

        Jesus Christ the righteous: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's

002:003<TD><font size=5>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his

002:004<TD><font size=5>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
        is a liar, and the truth is not in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
        even as he walked. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
        commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old
        commandment is the word which ye have heard from the
        beginning. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true
        in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true
        light now shineth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
        in darkness even until now. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
        none occasion of stumbling in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
        darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
        darkness hath blinded his eyes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>I write unto you, little children, because your sins are
        forgiven you for his name's sake. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
        from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye
        have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little
        children, because ye have known the Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him
        that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
        men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in
        you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
        If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
        lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father,
        but is of the world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
        doeth the will of God abideth for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
        that antichrist shall come, even now are there many
        antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
        had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us:
        but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they
        were not all of us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
        things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
        because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He
        is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he
        that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
        beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning
        shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in
        the Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
        life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>These things have I written unto you concerning them that
        seduce you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:027<TD><font size=5>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in
        you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
        anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
        lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:028<TD><font size=5>And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
        appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him
        at his coming. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:029<TD><font size=5>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
        doeth righteousness is born of him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
        that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
        knoweth us not, because it knew him not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
        appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
        appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
        even as he is pure. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin

        in him is no sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
        not seen him, neither known him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
        righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
        from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
        manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
        remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
        the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,

003:011<TD><font size=5>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
        we should love one another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
        And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,
        and his brother's righteous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
        love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in
        death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
        no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
        life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
        brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
        need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
        dwelleth the love of God in him? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
        tongue; but in deed and in truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
        our hearts before him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
        and knoweth all things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
        toward God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
        commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
        sight. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether

004:002<TD><font size=5>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
        that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

        the world heareth them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not
        of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and
        the spirit of error. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and

004:008<TD><font size=5>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
        God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
        live through him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,

        another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        hath given us of his Spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
        to be the Saviour of the world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in

        world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:

005:006<TD><font size=5>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
        not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
        Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
