<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
        separated unto the gospel of God, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
        scriptures,) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
        the seed of David according to the flesh; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
        spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
        to the faith among all nations, for his name: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
        Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
        your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
        gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
        always in my prayers; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
        prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
        spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
        mutual faith both of you and me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
        purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I
        might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
        Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
        the wise, and to the unwise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
        you that are at Rome also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
        power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to
        the Jew first, and also to the Greek. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
        faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
        ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
        unrighteousness; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
        for God hath shewed it unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
        are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
        made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
        without excuse: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as
        God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
        imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
        made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted
        beasts, and creeping things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
        lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
        between themselves: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
        served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for
        ever. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
        their women did change the natural use into that which is
        against nature: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
        woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
        working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
        that recompence of their error which was meet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>And even as they did not like to retain God in their
        knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
        things which are not convenient; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
        wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
        debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:030<TD><font size=5>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
        inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:031<TD><font size=5>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
        affection, implacable, unmerciful: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:032<TD><font size=5>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
        things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
        pleasure in them that do them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
        judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
        thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
        against them which commit such things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
        things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
        judgment of God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
        and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
        leadeth thee to repentance? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
        thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
        righteous judgment of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Who will render to every man according to his deeds: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
        glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
        but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
        evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,
        to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>For there is no respect of persons with God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
        without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
        judged by the law; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
        doers of the law shall be justified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
        the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
        are a law unto themselves: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
        conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
        while accusing or else excusing one another;) </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
        Christ according to my gospel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
        makest thy boast of God, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
        excellent, being instructed out of the law; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
        a light of them which are in darkness, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
        the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
        thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
        steal? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
        commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
        sacrilege? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
        law dishonourest thou God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
        you, as it is written. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
        if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
        uncircumcision. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
        law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:027<TD><font size=5>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil
        the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
        transgress the law? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:028<TD><font size=5>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
        circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:029<TD><font size=5>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
        that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose
        praise is not of men, but of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
        circumcision? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed
        the oracles of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
        the faith of God without effect? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it
        is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
        and mightest overcome when thou art judged. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
        what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
        speak as a man) </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
        his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
        affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
        damnation is just. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
        have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
        under sin; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
        after God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
        unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
        have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>Their feet are swift to shed blood: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Destruction and misery are in their ways: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And the way of peace have they not known: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>There is no fear of God before their eyes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
        them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
        and all the world may become guilty before God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
        justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
        sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>But now the righteousness of God without the law is
        manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
        Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is
        no difference: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
        that is in Christ Jesus: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
        his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
        sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
        might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
        Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:027<TD><font size=5>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
        Nay: but by the law of faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:028<TD><font size=5>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
        the deeds of the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:029<TD><font size=5>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the
        Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:030<TD><font size=5>Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
        faith, and uncircumcision through faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:031<TD><font size=5>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
        we establish the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
        to the flesh, hath found? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
        glory; but not before God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
        counted unto him for righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
        but of debt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
        justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
        righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
        whom God imputeth righteousness without works, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
        whose sins are covered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
        upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
        reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
        uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
        righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
        uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
        believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness
        might be imputed unto them also: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
        circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that
        faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
        uncircumcised. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
        not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
        the righteousness of faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
        and the promise made of none effect: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is
        no transgression. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
        end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
        only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
        faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
        before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
        dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
        were. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
        father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So
        shall thy seed be. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
        now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet
        the deadness of Sarah's womb: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
        was strong in faith, giving glory to God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
        able also to perform. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
        to him; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
        him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:025<TD><font size=5>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
        our justification. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
        through our Lord Jesus Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
        we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing
        that tribulation worketh patience; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>And patience, experience; and experience, hope: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
        abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
        for the ungodly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
        peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
        yet sinners, Christ died for us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
        saved from wrath through him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
        death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
        saved by his life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
        Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
        by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
        sinned: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
        imputed when there is no law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
        that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
        transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
        through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace
        of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
        Christ, hath abounded unto many. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
        judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of
        many offences unto justification. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
        they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
        righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
        the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
        where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign

010:003<TD><font size=5>For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
        about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted

010:005<TD><font size=5>For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
        That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:006<TD><font size=5>But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,

014:008<TD><font size=5>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
        die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
        we are the Lord's. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:009<TD><font size=5>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
        he might be Lord both of the dead and living. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:010<TD><font size=5>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
        nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
        seat of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:011<TD><font size=5>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
        bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:012<TD><font size=5>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:013<TD><font size=5>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
        this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion
        to fall in his brother's way. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:014<TD><font size=5>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
        nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing
        to be unclean, to him it is unclean. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:015<TD><font size=5>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
        not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
        died. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:016<TD><font size=5>Let not then your good be evil spoken of: </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:017<TD><font size=5>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
        righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:018<TD><font size=5>For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
        God, and approved of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:019<TD><font size=5>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
        and things wherewith one may edify another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:020<TD><font size=5>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
        pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:021<TD><font size=5>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
        thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
        made weak. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:022<TD><font size=5>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
        that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

014:023<TD><font size=5>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
        not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>015:001 <TD><font size=5>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
        weak, and not to please ourselves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:002<TD><font size=5>Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
        edification. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:003<TD><font size=5>For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,
        The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:004<TD><font size=5>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
        our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
        scriptures might have hope. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:005<TD><font size=5>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
        likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:006<TD><font size=5>That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:007<TD><font size=5>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
        to the glory of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:008<TD><font size=5>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
        for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
        fathers: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:009<TD><font size=5>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
        is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
        Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:010<TD><font size=5>And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:011<TD><font size=5>And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
        ye people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:012<TD><font size=5>And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
        he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall
        the Gentiles trust. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:013<TD><font size=5>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
        believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of
        the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:014<TD><font size=5>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
        also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able
        also to admonish one another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:015<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
        you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
        that is given to me of God, </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:016<TD><font size=5>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
        ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the
        Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
        Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:017<TD><font size=5>I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
        those things which pertain to God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:018<TD><font size=5>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
        Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient,
        by word and deed, </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:019<TD><font size=5>Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit
        of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto
        Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:020<TD><font size=5>Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
        was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:021<TD><font size=5>But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall
        see: and they that have not heard shall understand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:022<TD><font size=5>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
        you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:023<TD><font size=5>But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
        great desire these many years to come unto you; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:024<TD><font size=5>Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
        for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my
        way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
        your company. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:025<TD><font size=5>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:026<TD><font size=5>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
        certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:027<TD><font size=5>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
        if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
        things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal
        things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:028<TD><font size=5>When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
        this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:029<TD><font size=5>And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
        fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:030<TD><font size=5>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
        and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with
        me in your prayers to God for me; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:031<TD><font size=5>That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
        Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be
        accepted of the saints; </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:032<TD><font size=5>That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
        with you be refreshed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

015:033<TD><font size=5>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>
