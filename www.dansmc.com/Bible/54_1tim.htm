<center><h3>Book 54</h3><h1>1 TIMOTHY</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
        Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and
        peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
        Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
        other doctrine, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
        minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
        faith: so do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,
        and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
        jangling; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what
        they say, nor whereof they affirm. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
        but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
        sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
        murderers of mothers, for manslayers, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
        mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and
        if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
        doctrine; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
        committed to my trust. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
        that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
        but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
        and love which is in Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
        Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
        chief. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
        Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern
        to them which should hereafter believe on him to life
        everlasting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
        God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
        prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
        mightest war a good warfare; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
        away concerning faith have made shipwreck: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto
        Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
        prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all
        men; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead
        a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
        Saviour; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
        knowledge of the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
        the man Christ Jesus; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
        time. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak
        the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles
        in faith and verity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
        hands, without wrath and doubting. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
        apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided
        hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
        works. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
        the man, but to be in silence. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>For Adam was first formed, then Eve. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
        the transgression. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
        continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
        he desireth a good work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
        vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt
        to teach; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
        patient, not a brawler, not covetous; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
        subjection with all gravity; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he
        take care of the church of God?) </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
        condemnation of the devil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
        lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not
        given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
        office of a deacon, being found blameless. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
        faithful in all things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
        children and their own houses well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
        to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
        which is in Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
        shortly: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
        to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of
        the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
        was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
        angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
        received up into glory. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
        some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
        spirits, and doctrines of devils; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
        with a hot iron; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
        which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
        them which believe and know the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused,
        if it be received with thanksgiving: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
        shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
        words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
        attained. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
        rather unto godliness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is
        profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
        now is, and of that which is to come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
        trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men,
        specially of those that believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>These things command and teach. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
        believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
        faith, in purity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
        doctrine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
        prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that
        thy profiting may appear to all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
        them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
        that hear thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the
        younger men as brethren; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
        purity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>Honour widows that are widows indeed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
        first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for
        that is good and acceptable before God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God,
        and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of
        his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
        infidel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore
        years old, having been the wife of one man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
        children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
        saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
        diligently followed every good work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
        wanton against Christ, they will marry; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>Having damnation, because they have cast off their first
        faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house
        to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
        speaking things which they ought not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
        guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
        reproachfully. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>For some are already turned aside after Satan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them
        relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may
        relieve them that are widows indeed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
        honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
        treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his
        reward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
        three witnesses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
        elect angels, that thou observe these things without
        preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
        men's sins: keep thyself pure. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:023<TD><font size=5>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
        sake and thine often infirmities. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:024<TD><font size=5>Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
        and some men they follow after. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:025<TD><font size=5>Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand;
        and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>006:001 <TD><font size=5>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
        masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his
        doctrine be not blasphemed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:002<TD><font size=5>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
        them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
        because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
        benefit. These things teach and exhort. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:003<TD><font size=5>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
        words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
        doctrine which is according to godliness; </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:004<TD><font size=5>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
        strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
        surmisings, </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:005<TD><font size=5>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of
        the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such
        withdraw thyself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:006<TD><font size=5>But godliness with contentment is great gain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:007<TD><font size=5>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we
        can carry nothing out. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:008<TD><font size=5>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:009<TD><font size=5>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
        and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
        destruction and perdition. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:010<TD><font size=5>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
        some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
        pierced themselves through with many sorrows. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:011<TD><font size=5>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
        righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:012<TD><font size=5>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,

        profession before many witnesses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:013<TD><font size=5>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
        things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate

006:017<TD><font size=5>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
