<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
        shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
        and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
        John: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
        Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
        this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
        therein: for the time is at hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto
        you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
        to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his
        throne; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
        first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
        earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
        his own blood, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to
        him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
        and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
        shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
        Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
        Almighty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
        tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
        was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God,
        and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
        great voice, as of a trumpet, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
        What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
        churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
        unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
        Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
        turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
        Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
        about the paps with a golden girdle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
        and his eyes were as a flame of fire; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
        furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
        went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the
        sun shineth in his strength. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
        his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the
        first and the last: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
        evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which
        are, and the things which shall be hereafter; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
        hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
        the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks
        which thou sawest are the seven churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things
        saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
        walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
        thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried
        them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
        them liars: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast
        laboured, and hast not fainted. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
        left thy first love. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
        and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
        and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
        repent. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
        Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
        tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
        saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
        rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are
        Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
        devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be
        tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
        faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
        second death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
        saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's
        seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my
        faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful
        martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
        them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
        cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
        things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
        Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
        against them with the sword of my mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
        hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
        stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
        receiveth it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
        things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a
        flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
        patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
        first. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
        sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
        prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
        fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
        repented not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
        adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent
        of their deeds. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
        shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:
        and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
        have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of
        Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to
        him will I give power over the nations: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:027<TD><font size=5>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
        potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of
        my Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:028<TD><font size=5>And I will give him the morning star. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:029<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
        saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
        stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou
        livest, and art dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
        ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
        fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will
        come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I
        will come upon thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
        their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they
        are worthy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
        raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
        life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
        his angels. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
        things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath
        the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and
        shutteth, and no man openeth; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,
        and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and
        hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
        they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make
        them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I
        have loved thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
        keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
        all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that
        no man take thy crown. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my
        God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him
        the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which
        is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God:
        and I will write upon him my new name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
        These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
        the beginning of the creation of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
        thou wert cold or hot. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
        will spue thee out of my mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
        have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,
        and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
        mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
        clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
        and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
        and repent. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
        voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
        with him, and he with me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my

        Father in his throne. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
        and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
        talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
        thee things which must be hereafter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was
        set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
        stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in
        sight like unto an emerald. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
        upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
        in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
        voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the
        throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
        crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
        throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
        a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
        fourth beast was like a flying eagle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
        they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and
        night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was,
        and is, and is to come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
        that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
        the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
        cast their crowns before the throne, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
        power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
        they are and were created. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
        book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven
        seals. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
        worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
        was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
        to read the book, neither to look thereon. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
        Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
        to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
        four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
        it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
        are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
        that sat upon the throne. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
        twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
        them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
        prayers of saints. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
        book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
        hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
        tongue, and people, and nation; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
        reign on the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
        the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
        them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
        thousands; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
        receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
        honour, and glory, and blessing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
        under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
        in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
        power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
        Lamb for ever and ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
        fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>006:001 <TD><font size=5>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,
