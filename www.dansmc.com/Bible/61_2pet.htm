<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
        that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
        righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
        of God, and of Jesus our Lord, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
        that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
        him that hath called us to glory and virtue: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
        promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
        nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
        through lust. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
        virtue; and to virtue knowledge; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and
        to patience godliness; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
        charity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that
        ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
        our Lord Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
        off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
        calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall
        never fall: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
        into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
        remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
        established in the present truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to
        stir you up by putting you in remembrance; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even
        as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease
        to have these things always in remembrance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
        made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
        there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This
        is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
        with him in the holy mount. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
        well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
        place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
        hearts: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
        any private interpretation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
        holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
        there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
        bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
        them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
        the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
        merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time
        lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
        down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
        be reserved unto judgment; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
        person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood
        upon the world of the ungodly; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
        condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto
        those that after should live ungodly; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
        the wicked: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
        hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
        unlawful deeds;) </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
        and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
        punished: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
        uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they,
        selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring
        not railing accusation against them before the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
        destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
        and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that
        count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and
        blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while
        they feast with you; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
        beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with
        covetous practices; cursed children: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
        following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the
        wages of unrighteousness; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with
        man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
        tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they
        allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much
        wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live
        in error. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
        servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the
        same is he brought in bondage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
        through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
        they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end
        is worse with them than the beginning. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
        righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from
        the holy commandment delivered unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
        The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
        washed to her wallowing in the mire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both
        which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
        by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the
        apostles of the Lord and Saviour: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
        scoffers, walking after their own lusts, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
        fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
        beginning of the creation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
        God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
        water and in the water: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
        perished: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
        are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
        judgment and perdition of ungodly men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
        is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
        one day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
        count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
        that any should perish, but that all should come to
        repentance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
        the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
        the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
        the works that are therein shall be burned up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
        manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
        godliness, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
        wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
        elements shall melt with fervent heat? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
        heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
        diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot,
        and blameless. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation;
        even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom
        given unto him hath written unto you; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things;
        in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
        that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the
        other scriptures, unto their own destruction. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before,
        beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
        wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
        Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.
        Amen.</font>
