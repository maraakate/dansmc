<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
        seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
        generation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
        abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
        the land was filled with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
        Joseph. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
        children of Israel are more and mightier than we: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
        it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
        join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
        them up out of the land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
        with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
        cities, Pithom and Raamses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
        grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
        rigour: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
        their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
        the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
        Puah: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
        women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
        shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
        commanded them, but saved the men children alive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
        them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
        children alive? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
        are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
        delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
        multiplied, and waxed very mighty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
        made them houses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
        born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
        save alive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
        daughter of Levi. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
        that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
        ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
        put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
        river's brink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
        river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
        when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
        fetch it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
        the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
        is one of the Hebrews' children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
        call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
        the child for thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
        called the child's mother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
        and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
        women took the child, and nursed it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
        daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
        Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
        he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
        and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
        brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
        there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
        sand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
        Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
        wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
        intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
        Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
        of Midian: and he sat down by a well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
        and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
        flock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
        and helped them, and watered their flock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
        that ye are come so soon to day? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
        shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
        flock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
        that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
        Zipporah his daughter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
        said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
        died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
        bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
        reason of the bondage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
        respect unto them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
        priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
        desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
        out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
        bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
        sight, why the bush is not burnt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
        unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
        And he said, Here am I. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
        thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
        his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
        people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
        of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
        Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
        land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
        unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
        come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
        the Egyptians oppress them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
        thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
        of Egypt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
        Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
        out of Egypt? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
        a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
        brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
        this mountain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
        of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
        hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
        name? what shall I say unto them? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
        shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
        unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
        children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
        unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
        unto all generations. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
        them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
        Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
        and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
        say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
        and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
        the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
        not by a mighty hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
        wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
        he will let you go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
        shall not go empty. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
        sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
        and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
        your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
        believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
        LORD hath not appeared unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
        said, A rod. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
        ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
        it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
        it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
        it became a rod in his hand: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
        God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
        appeared unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
        into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
        he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
        his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
        bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
        neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
        believe the voice of the latter sign. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
        two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
        take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
        and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
        blood upon the dry land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
        neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
        servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
        maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
        not I the LORD? </font><TR><td valign=top>

        whom thou wilt send. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
        said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
        speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
        and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and

        you what ye shall do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall

004:017<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
        shalt do signs. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
        said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my

004:021<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
        Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
        which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
        that he shall not let the people go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel

039:029<TD><font size=5>And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

039:030<TD><font size=5>And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
        wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
        HOLINESS TO THE LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

039:031<TD><font size=5>And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high

039:042<TD><font size=5>According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>040:001 <TD><font size=5>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:002<TD><font size=5>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:003<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
        the ark with the vail. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:004<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
        that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
        the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:005<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
        the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
        the tabernacle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:006<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
        door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:007<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
        congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:008<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
        hanging at the court gate. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:009<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
        tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
        all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:010<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
        his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
        most holy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:011<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:012<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the

040:013<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
        him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the

040:014<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:015<TD><font size=5>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
        their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
        throughout their generations. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:016<TD><font size=5>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
        so did he. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:017<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
        the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:018<TD><font size=5>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
        and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
        and reared up his pillars. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:019<TD><font size=5>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
        covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
        Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:020<TD><font size=5>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
        staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:021<TD><font size=5>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
        vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
        the LORD commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:022<TD><font size=5>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
        side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:023<TD><font size=5>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
        LORD had commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:024<TD><font size=5>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
        over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
        southward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:025<TD><font size=5>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
        commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:026<TD><font size=5>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
        before the vail: </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:027<TD><font size=5>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
        Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:028<TD><font size=5>And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:029<TD><font size=5>And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
        it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
        commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:030<TD><font size=5>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
        the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:031<TD><font size=5>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
        feet thereat: </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:032<TD><font size=5>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
        they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
        commanded Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:033<TD><font size=5>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
        altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
        finished the work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:034<TD><font size=5>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
        glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:035<TD><font size=5>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
        congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
        of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:036<TD><font size=5>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
        children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:037<TD><font size=5>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
        till the day that it was taken up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

040:038<TD><font size=5>For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
        fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
        Israel, throughout all their journeys.
