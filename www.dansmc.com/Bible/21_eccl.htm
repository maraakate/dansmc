001:001 <TD><font size=5>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
        all is vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
        the sun? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
        but the earth abideth for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
        his place where he arose. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
        north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
        again according to his circuits. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
        the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
        again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
        which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
        thing under the sun. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
        it hath been already of old time, which was before us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
        be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
        shall come after. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
        concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
        travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
        therewith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
        behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
        is wanting cannot be numbered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
        estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
        been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
        experience of wisdom and knowledge. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
        folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
        knowledge increaseth sorrow. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
        therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
        acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
        till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
        they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
        vineyards: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
        all kind of fruits: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
        bringeth forth trees: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
        house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
        above all that were in Jerusalem before me: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
        of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
        singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
        instruments, and that of all sorts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
        me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
        withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
        all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
        on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
        vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
        the sun. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
        for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
        which hath been already done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
        excelleth darkness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
        darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
        to them all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
        happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
        said in my heart, that this also is vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
        for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
        all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
        the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
        spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
        because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
        shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
        and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
        also vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
        labour which I took under the sun. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
        knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
        therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
        and a great evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
        his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
        heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
        drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
        labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:026<TD><font size=5>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
        knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
        gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
        before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
        under the heaven: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
        time to pluck up that which is planted; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
        a time to build up; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
        time to dance; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
        together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
        embracing; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
        a time to speak; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
        of peace. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
        men to be exercised in it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
        set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
        work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
        rejoice, and to do good in his life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
        good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
        nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
        doeth it, that men should fear before him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
        already been; and God requireth that which is past. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
        wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
        iniquity was there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
        wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
        every work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
        that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
        they themselves are beasts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
        even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
        other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
        preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
        dust again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
        spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
        man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
        for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
        done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
        oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
        oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
        the living which are yet alive. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
        hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
        for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
        and vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
        with travail and vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
        neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
        labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
        saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
        This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
        their labour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
        him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
        help him up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
        one be warm alone? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
        threefold cord is not quickly broken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
        king, who will no more be admonished. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
        born in his kingdom becometh poor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
        second child that shall stand up in his stead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
        before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
        him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
        ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
        consider not that they do evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
        to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
        upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
        fool's voice is known by multitude of words. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
        hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
        shouldest vow and not pay. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
        thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
        God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
        hands? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
        divers vanities: but fear thou God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
        perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
        at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
        regardeth; and there be higher than they. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
        is served by the field. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
        he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
        what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
        of them with their eyes? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
        or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
        sleep. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
        riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
        son, and there is nothing in his hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
        to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
        he may carry away in his hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
        the wind? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
        sorrow and wrath with his sickness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
        to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
        that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
        God giveth him: for it is his portion. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
        hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
        God answereth him in the joy of his heart. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>006:001 <TD><font size=5>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
        common among men: </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:002<TD><font size=5>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
        that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,

        untimely birth is better than he. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:004<TD><font size=5>For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
        his name shall be covered with darkness. </font><TR><td valign=top>
