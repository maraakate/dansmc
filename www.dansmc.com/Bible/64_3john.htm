001:001 <TD><font size=5>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
        truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
        be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
        of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
        truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
        truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
        brethren, and to strangers; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
        whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
        sort, thou shalt do well: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
        nothing of the Gentiles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
        fellowhelpers to the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
        the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
        doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
        content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
        brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
        of the church. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
        good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
        hath not seen God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
        itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
        record is true. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
        write unto thee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
        to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
        friends by name.</font>
