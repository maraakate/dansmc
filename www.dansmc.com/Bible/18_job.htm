<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
        that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
        eschewed evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
        thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
        hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
        man was the greatest of all the men of the east. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
        day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
        drink with them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
        about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
        the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
        number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
        sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
        continually. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
        answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
        earth, and from walking up and down in it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
        nought? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
        and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
        land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
        he will curse thee to thy face. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
        thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
        Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
        eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
        plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
        have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
        am escaped alone to tell thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
        sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
        escaped alone to tell thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
        and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
        thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
        their eldest brother's house: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
        smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
        young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
        tell thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
        fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
        shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
        away; blessed be the name of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
        present himself before the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
        Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
        the earth, and from walking up and down in it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
        still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
        against him, to destroy him without cause. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
        that a man hath will he give for his life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
        flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
        save his life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
        Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
        sat down among the ashes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
        integrity? curse God, and die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
        women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
        God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
        sin with his lips. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
        come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
        the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
        Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
        to mourn with him and to comfort him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
        they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
        his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
        nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
        grief was very great. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And Job spake, and said, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
        it was said, There is a man child conceived. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
        neither let the light shine upon it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
        dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
        joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
        number of the months. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
        therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
        up their mourning. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
        light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
        day: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
        sorrow from mine eyes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
        when I came out of the belly? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
        suck? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
        slept: then had I been at rest, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
        places for themselves; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
        silver: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
        which never saw light. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
        at rest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
        the oppressor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
        his master. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
        unto the bitter in soul; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
        than for hid treasures; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
        the grave? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
        hath hedged in? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
        out like the waters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
        which I was afraid of is come unto me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
        yet trouble came. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
        who can withhold himself from speaking? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
        the weak hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
        strengthened the feeble knees. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        thee, and thou art troubled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
        uprightness of thy ways? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
        where were the righteous cut off? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
        wickedness, reap the same. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
        nostrils are they consumed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
        the teeth of the young lions, are broken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
        whelps are scattered abroad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
        a little thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        falleth on men, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to

004:016<TD><font size=5>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
        image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a

        pure than his maker? </font><TR><td valign=top>

        foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>042:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Job answered the LORD, and said, </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:006<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:007<TD><font size=5>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
        Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
        kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
        not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job

042:008<TD><font size=5>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and

        I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye

        bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
        LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
        money, and every one an earring of gold. </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:012<TD><font size=5>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
        beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
        thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
        she asses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:013<TD><font size=5>He had also seven sons and three daughters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:014<TD><font size=5>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of

042:015<TD><font size=5>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the

        their brethren. </font><TR><td valign=top>

042:016<TD><font size=5>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his

042:017<TD><font size=5>So Job died, being old and full of days.</font>
