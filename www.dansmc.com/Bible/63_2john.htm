001:001 <td><font size=5>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
        the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
        the truth; </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:002<td><font size=5>For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
        us for ever.</font> <tr><td valign=top>

001:003<td><font size=5>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
        from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
        and love. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:004<td><font size=5>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
        truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:005<td><font size=5>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
        commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
        beginning, that we love one another. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:006<td><font size=5>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
        the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
        should walk in it. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:007<td><font size=5>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
        that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
        an antichrist. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:008<td><font size=5>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
        have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:009<td><font size=5>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
        Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
        Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</font> <tr><td valign=top>

001:010<td><font size=5>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
        receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</font> <tr><td valign=top>

001:011<td><font size=5>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
        deeds. </font><tr><td valign=top>

001:012<td><font size=5>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
        paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
        face, that our joy may be full.</font> <tr><td valign=top>
