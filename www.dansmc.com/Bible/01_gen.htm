001:001 <TD><font size=5>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>And the evening and the morning were the third day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:030<TD><font size=5>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:031<TD><font size=5>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
        and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
        sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
        the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
        of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
        his offering: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
        was very wroth, and his countenance fell. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
        thy countenance fallen? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
        doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
        his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
        when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
        his brother, and slew him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
        said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
        blood crieth unto me from the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
        mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
        unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
        be in the earth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
        can bear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
        earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
        fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
        pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
        vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
        mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
        the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
        he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
        name of his son, Enoch. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
        Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
        Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
        tents, and of such as have cattle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
        such as handle the harp and organ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
        artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
        Naamah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
        voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
        slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and

        his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
        seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:026<TD><font size=5>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called

031:020<TD><font size=5>And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
        told him not that he fled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:021<TD><font size=5>So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
        over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:022<TD><font size=5>And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:023<TD><font size=5>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
        days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:024<TD><font size=5>And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
        unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
        or bad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:025<TD><font size=5>Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in

031:026<TD><font size=5>And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
        stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
        captives taken with the sword? </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:027<TD><font size=5>Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
        me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
        with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:028<TD><font size=5>And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
        thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:029<TD><font size=5>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
        your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
        that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:030<TD><font size=5>And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
        longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
        stolen my gods? </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:031<TD><font size=5>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
        for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
        daughters from me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:032<TD><font size=5>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
        before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
        take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
        them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:033<TD><font size=5>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
        into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
        went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:034<TD><font size=5>Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
        furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
        but found them not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:035<TD><font size=5>And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
        I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
        me. And he searched but found not the images. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:036<TD><font size=5>And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
        and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
        thou hast so hotly pursued after me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:037<TD><font size=5>Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
        of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
        thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:038<TD><font size=5>This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
        goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
        have I not eaten. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:039<TD><font size=5>That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
        the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
        stolen by day, or stolen by night. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:040<TD><font size=5>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
        by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:041<TD><font size=5>Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
        fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
        cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:042<TD><font size=5>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
        of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
        empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
        hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:043<TD><font size=5>And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
        daughters, and these children are my children, and these
        cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
        what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
        children which they have born? </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:044<TD><font size=5>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;

031:045<TD><font size=5>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:046<TD><font size=5>And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
        stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the

031:047<TD><font size=5>And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
        Galeed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:048<TD><font size=5>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
        this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:049<TD><font size=5>And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
        when we are absent one from another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:050<TD><font size=5>If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take

        is witness betwixt me and thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:051<TD><font size=5>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
        pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

031:052<TD><font size=5>This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
        not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass

031:053<TD><font size=5>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their

031:054<TD><font size=5>Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his

031:055<TD><font size=5>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons

032:005<TD><font size=5>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and

032:007<TD><font size=5>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided

        the other company which is left shall escape. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:009<TD><font size=5>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
        father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
        country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:010<TD><font size=5>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
        the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
        my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
        bands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:011<TD><font size=5>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the

032:012<TD><font size=5>And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
        as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
        multitude. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:013<TD><font size=5>And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which

032:016<TD><font size=5>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every

        before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:017<TD><font size=5>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother

        whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:018<TD><font size=5>Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a

        us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:019<TD><font size=5>And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that

032:020<TD><font size=5>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.

        will accept of me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:021<TD><font size=5>So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that

        out of joint, as he wrestled with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:026<TD><font size=5>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I

032:027<TD><font size=5>And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. </font><TR><td valign=top>

032:028<TD><font size=5>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but

032:029<TD><font size=5>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.

032:032<TD><font size=5>Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
        shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:

041:028<TD><font size=5>This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God

041:029<TD><font size=5>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
        the land of Egypt: </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:030<TD><font size=5>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
        all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
        the famine shall consume the land; </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:031<TD><font size=5>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
        that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:032<TD><font size=5>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
        because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
        bring it to pass. </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:033<TD><font size=5>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
        and set him over the land of Egypt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:034<TD><font size=5>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
        land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
        seven plenteous years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:035<TD><font size=5>And let them gather all the food of those good years that
        come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
        keep food in the cities. </font><TR><td valign=top>

041:036<TD><font size=5>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
        years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the

047:021<TD><font size=5>And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end

047:023<TD><font size=5>Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you

048:002<TD><font size=5>And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh

        the firstborn. </font><TR><td valign=top>
