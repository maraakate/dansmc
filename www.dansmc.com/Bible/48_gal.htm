<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
        Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
        Galatia: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
        Lord Jesus Christ, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
        this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
        Father: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
        into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
        would pervert the gospel of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
        gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
        him be accursed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any
        other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
        accursed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
        for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
        preached of me is not after man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but
        by the revelation of Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
        religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
        God, and wasted it: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
        mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
        traditions of my fathers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
        womb, and called me by his grace, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
        heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
        before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
        Damascus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
        and abode with him fifteen days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
        brother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I
        lie not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were
        in Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
        past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And they glorified God in me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
        Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
        gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to
        them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run,
        or had run, in vain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
        compelled to be circumcised: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
        came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
        Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that
        the truth of the gospel might continue with you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
        it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for
        they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to
        me: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
        uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
        circumcision was unto Peter; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
        of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
        Gentiles:) </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
        perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me
        and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go
        unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
        which I also was forward to do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
        face, because he was to be blamed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
        Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
        himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
        Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
        truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If
        thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
        not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live
        as do the Jews? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
        but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
        Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
        Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of
        the law shall no flesh be justified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
        also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of
        sin? God forbid. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
        myself a transgressor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
        unto God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
        Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
        flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
        gave himself for me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come
        by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
        not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
        evidently set forth, crucified among you? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
        works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
        perfect by the flesh? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
        miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by
        the hearing of faith? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
        righteousness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
        the children of Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
        heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto
        Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
        Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
        curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth
        not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
        it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
        shall live in them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
        a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
        hangeth on a tree: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
        through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
        Spirit through faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
        man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth,
        or addeth thereto. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
        not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
        which is Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
        of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
        years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
        of none effect. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
        promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
        transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise
        was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
        mediator. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
        if there had been a law given which could have given life,
        verily righteousness should have been by the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
        promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
        believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
        unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
        Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
        schoolmaster. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:027<TD><font size=5>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
        on Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:028<TD><font size=5>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
        free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
        Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:029<TD><font size=5>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
        according to the promise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
        nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
        the father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
        elements of the world: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
        Son, made of a woman, made under the law, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
        the adoption of sons. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
        Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
        then an heir of God through Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them
        which by nature are no gods. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of
        God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements,
        whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
        vain. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye
        have not injured me at all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
        gospel unto you at the first. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
        rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
        Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
        record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked
        out your own eyes, and have given them to me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
        truth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would
        exclude you, that ye might affect them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good
        thing, and not only when I am present with you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
        Christ be formed in you, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice;
        for I stand in doubt of you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
        the law? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
        bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but
        he of the freewoman was by promise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
        the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
        which is Agar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:025<TD><font size=5>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
        Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:026<TD><font size=5>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
        us all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:027<TD><font size=5>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
        break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the
        desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
        husband. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:028<TD><font size=5>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:029<TD><font size=5>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
        that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:030<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
        and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
        with the son of the freewoman. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:031<TD><font size=5>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
        of the free. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
        us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
        shall profit you nothing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
        is a debtor to do the whole law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
        justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
        by faith. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
        nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
        the truth? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
        none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
        his judgment, whosoever he be. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
        suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>I would they were even cut off which trouble you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
        liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
        another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
        shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be

005:016<TD><font size=5>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
        the lust of the flesh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
        against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
        other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
        Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
        strife, seditions, heresies, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
        the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
        past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
        kingdom of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
        longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:023<TD><font size=5>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:024<TD><font size=5>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
        affections and lusts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:025<TD><font size=5>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:026<TD><font size=5>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>006:001 <TD><font size=5>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
        spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
        considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:002<TD><font size=5>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:003<TD><font size=5>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is
        nothing, he deceiveth himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:004<TD><font size=5>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
        rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:006<TD><font size=5>Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that

006:007<TD><font size=5>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
        soweth, that shall he also reap. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:008<TD><font size=5>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
        corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the

006:009<TD><font size=5>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
        shall reap, if we faint not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:010<TD><font size=5>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,

006:011<TD><font size=5>Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
        own hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:012<TD><font size=5>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
        constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
        persecution for the cross of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:013<TD><font size=5>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;

006:014<TD><font size=5>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
