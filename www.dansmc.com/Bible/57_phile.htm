<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
        unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
        and to the church in thy house: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
        Jesus, and toward all saints; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
        the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
        Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
        bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
        thee that which is convenient, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
        as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
        bonds: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
        profitable to thee and to me: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
        mine own bowels: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
        have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
        should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
        shouldest receive him for ever; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
        specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
        flesh, and in the Lord? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
        account; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
        albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
        own self besides. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
        bowels in the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
        that thou wilt also do more than I say. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
        your prayers I shall be given unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</font>
