<center><h3>Book 32</h3><h1>JONAH</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
        saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
        their wickedness is come up before me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
        the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
        Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,
        to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was
        a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
        broken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
        god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the
        sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
        sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
        thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
        will think upon us, that we perish not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
        lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
        cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
        whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people
        art thou? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD,
        the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why
        hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
        presence of the LORD, because he had told them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the
        sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
        tempestuous. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
        sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my
        sake this great tempest is upon you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
        they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
        against them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee,
        O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
        life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,
        hast done as it pleased thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
        the sea ceased from her raging. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
        And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
        nights. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
        belly, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
        and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
        heardest my voice. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
        seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and
        thy waves passed over me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
        toward thy holy temple. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
        closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
        her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
        life from corruption, O LORD my God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
        prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
        I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
        upon the dry land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
        saying, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
        the preaching that I bid thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
        of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
        days' journey. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
        cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
        overthrown. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
        least of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
        throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with
        sackcloth, and sat in ashes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
        Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
        neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
        them not feed, nor drink water: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
        mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
        way, and from the violence that is in their hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
        his fierce anger, that we perish not? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
        and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
        do unto them; and he did it not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
        was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
        Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
        art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
        kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
        city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
        shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
        Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
        from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
        and it smote the gourd that it withered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
        a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
        that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
        better for me to die than to live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
        gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
        which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
        came up in a night, and perished in a night: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
        more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
        between their right hand and their left hand; and also much
        cattle?</font>
