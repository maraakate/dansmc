<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
        the Word was God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>The same was in the beginning with God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
        made that was made. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>In him was life; and the life was the light of men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
        comprehended it not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
        that all men through him might believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
        Light. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
        into the world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
        world knew him not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>He came unto his own, and his own received him not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
        the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
        nor of the will of man, but of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
        beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
        Father,) full of grace and truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of
        whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me:
        for he was before me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
        Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which
        is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
        Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I
        am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
        answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
        straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
        then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
        prophet? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:026<TD><font size=5>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
        standeth one among you, whom ye know not; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:027<TD><font size=5>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
        shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:028<TD><font size=5>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
        was baptizing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:029<TD><font size=5>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
        Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
        world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:030<TD><font size=5>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
        preferred before me: for he was before me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:031<TD><font size=5>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
        Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:032<TD><font size=5>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
        heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:033<TD><font size=5>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
        the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
        descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which
        baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:034<TD><font size=5>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:035<TD><font size=5>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:036<TD><font size=5>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb
        of God! </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:037<TD><font size=5>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
        Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:038<TD><font size=5>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
        them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to
        say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:039<TD><font size=5>He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he
        dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
        hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:040<TD><font size=5>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
        Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:041<TD><font size=5>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
        have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
        Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:042<TD><font size=5>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
        said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
        Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:043<TD><font size=5>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and
        findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:044<TD><font size=5>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:045<TD><font size=5>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
        him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,
        Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:046<TD><font size=5>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out
        of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:047<TD><font size=5>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
        Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:048<TD><font size=5>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus
        answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee,
        when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:049<TD><font size=5>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son
        of God; thou art the King of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:050<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I
        saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
        greater things than these. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:051<TD><font size=5>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
        Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
        ascending and descending upon the Son of man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
        the mother of Jesus was there: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
        They have no wine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
        hour is not yet come. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
        you, do it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
        manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
        firkins apiece. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
        filled them up to the brim. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
        governor of the feast. And they bare it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
        wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
        the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the
        bridegroom, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
        good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
        worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
        manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and
        his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not
        many days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
        doves, and the changers of money sitting: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
        all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
        out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
        make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
        thine house hath eaten me up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest
        thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in
        three days I will raise it up. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
        building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>But he spake of the temple of his body. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
        remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed
        the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
        day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles
        which he did. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew
        all men, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew
        what was in man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
        the Jews: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
        know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
        these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
        thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
        old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and
        be born? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
        be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
        kingdom of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
        born of the Spirit is spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
        thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
        goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
        and knowest not these things? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
        testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
        shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
        from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
        must the Son of man be lifted up: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
        eternal life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
        Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
        have everlasting life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
        but that the world through him might be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
        believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
        believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
        world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
        deeds were evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
        to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
        may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land
        of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:023<TD><font size=5>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because
        there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:024<TD><font size=5>For John was not yet cast into prison. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:025<TD><font size=5>Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples
        and the Jews about purifying. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:026<TD><font size=5>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
        with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,
        the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:027<TD><font size=5>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it
        be given him from heaven. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:028<TD><font size=5>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the
        Christ, but that I am sent before him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:029<TD><font size=5>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of
        the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
        greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy
        therefore is fulfilled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:030<TD><font size=5>He must increase, but I must decrease. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:031<TD><font size=5>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
        earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh
        from heaven is above all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:032<TD><font size=5>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no
        man receiveth his testimony. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:033<TD><font size=5>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that
        God is true. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:034<TD><font size=5>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
        giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:035<TD><font size=5>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
        hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:036<TD><font size=5>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he
        that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath
        of God abideth on him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
        Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>And he must needs go through Samaria. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
        near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son
        Joseph. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
        with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
        sixth hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
        unto her, Give me to drink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

        being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
        for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
        God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
        wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
        living water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
        and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
        water? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
        well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
        cattle? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
        water shall thirst again: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
        shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
        be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
        thirst not, neither come hither to draw. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said
        unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is
        not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
        prophet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:020<TD><font size=5>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
        Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:021<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
        ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
        worship the Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:022<TD><font size=5>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
        salvation is of the Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:023<TD><font size=5>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
        shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the
        Father seeketh such to worship him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:024<TD><font size=5>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
        spirit and in truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:025<TD><font size=5>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
        called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:026<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:027<TD><font size=5>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
        with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
        talkest thou with her? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:028<TD><font size=5>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
        city, and saith to the men, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:029<TD><font size=5>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is
        not this the Christ? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:030<TD><font size=5>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:031<TD><font size=5>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
        eat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:032<TD><font size=5>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:033<TD><font size=5>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
        brought him ought to eat? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:034<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
        sent me, and to finish his work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:035<TD><font size=5>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh
        harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look
        on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:036<TD><font size=5>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
        life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may
        rejoice together. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:037<TD><font size=5>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another
        reapeth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:038<TD><font size=5>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
        men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:039<TD><font size=5>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for
        the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that
        ever I did. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:040<TD><font size=5>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
        that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:041<TD><font size=5>And many more believed because of his own word; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:042<TD><font size=5>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
        saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is
        indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:043<TD><font size=5>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:044<TD><font size=5>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in
        his own country. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:045<TD><font size=5>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received
        him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at
        the feast: for they also went unto the feast. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:046<TD><font size=5>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the
        water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was
        sick at Capernaum. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:047<TD><font size=5>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
        he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down,
        and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:048<TD><font size=5>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
        will not believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:049<TD><font size=5>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:050<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
        believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went
        his way. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:051<TD><font size=5>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
        him, saying, Thy son liveth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:052<TD><font size=5>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
        they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
        left him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:053<TD><font size=5>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
        Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and
        his whole house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:054<TD><font size=5>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was
        come out of Judaea into Galilee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
        Jerusalem. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
        called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
        halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
        troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling
        of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
        he had. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
        eight years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
        time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
        water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
        coming, another steppeth down before me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
        and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
        sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto
        me, Take up thy bed, and walk. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
        Take up thy bed, and walk? </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
        conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
        Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
        come unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:015<TD><font size=5>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
        had made him whole. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
        him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
        work. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
        only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his
        Father, making himself equal with God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
        unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth
        the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also
        doeth the Son likewise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
        himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these,
        that ye may marvel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
        even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
        unto the Son: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:023<TD><font size=5>That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
        Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father
        which hath sent him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:024<TD><font size=5>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
        believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
        shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
        unto life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:025<TD><font size=5>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
        is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and
        they that hear shall live. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:026<TD><font size=5>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
        the Son to have life in himself; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:027<TD><font size=5>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
        he is the Son of man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:028<TD><font size=5>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
        that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:029<TD><font size=5>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
        resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
        resurrection of damnation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:030<TD><font size=5>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
        judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the
        will of the Father which hath sent me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:031<TD><font size=5>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:032<TD><font size=5>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that
        the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:033<TD><font size=5>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:034<TD><font size=5>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
        that ye might be saved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:035<TD><font size=5>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for
        a season to rejoice in his light. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:036<TD><font size=5>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works
        which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that
        I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:037<TD><font size=5>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness
        of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen
        his shape. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:038<TD><font size=5>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath

005:039<TD><font size=5>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
        life: and they are they which testify of me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:040<TD><font size=5>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:041<TD><font size=5>I receive not honour from men. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:042<TD><font size=5>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:022<TD><font size=5>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is

        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:030<TD><font size=5>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
        place where Martha met him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:031<TD><font size=5>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
        her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went
        out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep
        there. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:032<TD><font size=5>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
        down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
        here, my brother had not died. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:033<TD><font size=5>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
        weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was
        troubled. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:034<TD><font size=5>And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
        come and see. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:035<TD><font size=5>Jesus wept. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:036<TD><font size=5>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:037<TD><font size=5>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
        eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
        have died? </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:038<TD><font size=5>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
        It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:039<TD><font size=5>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
        that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:
        for he hath been dead four days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:040<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
        wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:041<TD><font size=5>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead
        was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I
        thank thee that thou hast heard me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:042<TD><font size=5>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
        people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that
        thou hast sent me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:043<TD><font size=5>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
        Lazarus, come forth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:044<TD><font size=5>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
        graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.
        Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:045<TD><font size=5>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
        things which Jesus did, believed on him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:046<TD><font size=5>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told
        them what things Jesus had done. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:047<TD><font size=5>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
        and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:048<TD><font size=5>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
        Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:049<TD><font size=5>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
        same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:050<TD><font size=5>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
        die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:051<TD><font size=5>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
        year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:052<TD><font size=5>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
        together in one the children of God that were scattered
        abroad. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:053<TD><font size=5>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
        him to death. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:054<TD><font size=5>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
        thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
        called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:055<TD><font size=5>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
        the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify
        themselves. </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:056<TD><font size=5>Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as
        they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come
        to the feast? </font><TR><td valign=top>

011:057<TD><font size=5>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a

        shew it, that they might take him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>012:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
        Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the

012:002<TD><font size=5>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus
        was one of them that sat at the table with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:003<TD><font size=5>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
        and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her
        hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:004<TD><font size=5>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
        which should betray him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:005<TD><font size=5>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
        given to the poor? </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:006<TD><font size=5>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he
        was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:007<TD><font size=5>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying

012:009<TD><font size=5>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
        they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
        Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:010<TD><font size=5>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
        also to death; </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:011<TD><font size=5>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and

012:012<TD><font size=5>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when

012:013<TD><font size=5>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and

012:014<TD><font size=5>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it

012:015<TD><font size=5>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting
        on an ass's colt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:016<TD><font size=5>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
        when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these

        things unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:017<TD><font size=5>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
        out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:018<TD><font size=5>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
        that he had done this miracle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:019<TD><font size=5>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how

012:020<TD><font size=5>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to

012:024<TD><font size=5>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall

012:027<TD><font size=5>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
        from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:028<TD><font size=5>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
        saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:029<TD><font size=5>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that
        it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:030<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,
        but for your sakes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:031<TD><font size=5>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of

012:033<TD><font size=5>This he said, signifying what death he should die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:034<TD><font size=5>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
        Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man
        must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:035<TD><font size=5>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light

        he goeth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:036<TD><font size=5>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the

012:037<TD><font size=5>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
        believed not on him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:038<TD><font size=5>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,

012:039<TD><font size=5>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said
        again, </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:040<TD><font size=5>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that
        they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their

012:041<TD><font size=5>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:042<TD><font size=5>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;

        they should be put out of the synagogue: </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:043<TD><font size=5>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:044<TD><font size=5>Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not

012:045<TD><font size=5>And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

012:046<TD><font size=5>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on

012:049<TD><font size=5>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,

        backward, and fell to the ground. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:007<TD><font size=5>Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus
        of Nazareth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:008<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
        seek me, let these go their way: </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:009<TD><font size=5>That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them
        which thou gavest me have I lost none. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:010<TD><font size=5>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
        priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's
        name was Malchus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:011<TD><font size=5>Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
        the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:012<TD><font size=5>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took
        Jesus, and bound him, </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:013<TD><font size=5>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to
        Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:014<TD><font size=5>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it
        was expedient that one man should die for the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:015<TD><font size=5>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
        that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with
        Jesus into the palace of the high priest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:016<TD><font size=5>But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
        disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto
        her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:017<TD><font size=5>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
        thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:018<TD><font size=5>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
        of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and
        Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:019<TD><font size=5>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
        doctrine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:020<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
        in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always
        resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:021<TD><font size=5>Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
        unto them: behold, they know what I said. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:022<TD><font size=5>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood
        by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest
        thou the high priest so? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:023<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
        evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:024<TD><font size=5>Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:025<TD><font size=5>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
        unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied
        it, and said, I am not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:026<TD><font size=5>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman
        whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the
        garden with him? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:027<TD><font size=5>Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:028<TD><font size=5>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:
        and it was early; and they themselves went not into the
        judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they
        might eat the passover. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:029<TD><font size=5>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation
        bring ye against this man? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:030<TD><font size=5>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,
        we would not have delivered him up unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:031<TD><font size=5>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him
        according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is
        not lawful for us to put any man to death: </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:032<TD><font size=5>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
        signifying what death he should die. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:033<TD><font size=5>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
        Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:034<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did
        others tell it thee of me? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:035<TD><font size=5>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
        priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:036<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
        were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
        should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not
        from hence. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:037<TD><font size=5>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
        answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I
        born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should
        bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth
        heareth my voice. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:038<TD><font size=5>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
        this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
        find in him no fault at all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:039<TD><font size=5>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at
        the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the
        King of the Jews? </font><TR><td valign=top>

018:040<TD><font size=5>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.
        Now Barabbas was a robber. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>019:001 <TD><font size=5>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:002<TD><font size=5>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
        head, and they put on him a purple robe, </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:003<TD><font size=5>And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with
        their hands. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:004<TD><font size=5>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them,

        no fault in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:005<TD><font size=5>Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
        purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:006<TD><font size=5>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they
        cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto
        them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in
        him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:007<TD><font size=5>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought
        to die, because he made himself the Son of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:008<TD><font size=5>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more
        afraid; </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:009<TD><font size=5>And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
        Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:010<TD><font size=5>Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
        thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to
        release thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:011<TD><font size=5>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me,
        except it were given thee from above: therefore he that
        delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:012<TD><font size=5>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the
        Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not
        Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
        against Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:013<TD><font size=5>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus
        forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is
        called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:014<TD><font size=5>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the
        sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:015<TD><font size=5>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
        Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief
        priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:016<TD><font size=5>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
        they took Jesus, and led him away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:017<TD><font size=5>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
        place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:018<TD><font size=5>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either
        side one, and Jesus in the midst. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:019<TD><font size=5>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
        writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:020<TD><font size=5>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where
        Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written
        in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:021<TD><font size=5>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
        The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:022<TD><font size=5>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:023<TD><font size=5>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
        garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and
        also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the
        top throughout. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:024<TD><font size=5>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
        cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
        be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
        and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore
        the soldiers did. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:025<TD><font size=5>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
        mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
        Magdalene. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:026<TD><font size=5>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
        by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy
        son! </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:027<TD><font size=5>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
        that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:028<TD><font size=5>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now
        accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I
        thirst. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:029<TD><font size=5>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
        spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his
        mouth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:030<TD><font size=5>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
        finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:031<TD><font size=5>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
        bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day,
        (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that
        their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:032<TD><font size=5>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and
        of the other which was crucified with him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:033<TD><font size=5>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
        they brake not his legs: </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:034<TD><font size=5>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
        forthwith came there out blood and water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:035<TD><font size=5>And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
        knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:036<TD><font size=5>For these things were done, that the scripture should be
        fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:037<TD><font size=5>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
        they pierced. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:038<TD><font size=5>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of
        Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that
        he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him
        leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

019:039<TD><font size=5>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to

        is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
        he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and
        did cast himself into the sea. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:008<TD><font size=5>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were
        not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
        dragging the net with fishes. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:009<TD><font size=5>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
        coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:010<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
        caught. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:011<TD><font size=5>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
        fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were
        so many, yet was not the net broken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:012<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the
        disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the
        Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:013<TD><font size=5>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
        likewise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:014<TD><font size=5>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
        disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:015<TD><font size=5>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
        of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
        Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
        Feed my lambs. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:016<TD><font size=5>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
        lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
        that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:017<TD><font size=5>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
        thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
        time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
        all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
        him, Feed my sheep. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:018<TD><font size=5>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
        girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
        thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
        another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest
        not. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:019<TD><font size=5>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
        And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:020<TD><font size=5>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
        following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and
        said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:021<TD><font size=5>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man
        do? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:022<TD><font size=5>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
        what is that to thee? follow thou me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:023<TD><font size=5>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
        disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
        not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
        that to thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:024<TD><font size=5>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
        wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. </font><TR><td valign=top>

021:025<TD><font size=5>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
        which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that
        even the world itself could not contain the books that should
        be written. Amen.</font>
