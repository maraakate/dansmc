<center><h3>Book 28</h3><h1>HOSEA</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
        in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
        Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
        Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
        said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
        children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
        whoredom, departing from the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
        conceived, and bare him a son. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
        little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
        house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
        house of Israel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
        bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
        unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
        mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
        away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
        them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
        by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
        son. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
        and I will not be your God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
        of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
        shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
        them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
        Ye are the sons of the living God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
        gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
        shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
        Jezreel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
        am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
        of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
        born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
        land, and slay her with thirst. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
        children of whoredoms. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
        them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
        lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
        flax, mine oil and my drink. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
        make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
        overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
        them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
        husband; for then was it better with me than now. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
        and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
        Baal. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
        thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
        my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
        lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
        new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
        hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
        and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
        shall eat them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
        burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
        earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
        forgat me, saith the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
        wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
        of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
        the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
        of the land of Egypt. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
        call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
        they shall no more be remembered by their name. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
        beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
        creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
        the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
        to lie down safely. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
        thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
        lovingkindness, and in mercies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
        shalt know the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
        LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
        and they shall hear Jezreel. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
        upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
        which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
        say, Thou art my God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
        her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
        LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
        and love flagons of wine. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
        homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
        shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
        man: so will I also be for thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
        king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
        without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
        LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
        and his goodness in the latter days. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
        hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
        there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
        land. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
        committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
        therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
        taken away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
        as they that strive with the priest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
        shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
        mother. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
        hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
        shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
        of thy God, I will also forget thy children. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
        will I change their glory into shame. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
        their iniquity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
        punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
        whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
        to take heed to the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
        declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
        them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
        incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
        because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
        shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
        nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
        separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
        therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
        offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
        Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. </font><TR><td valign=top>
