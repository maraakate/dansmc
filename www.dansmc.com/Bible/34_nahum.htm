<center><h3>Book 34</h3><h1>NAHUM</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
        Elkoshite. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
        and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
        adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
        all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
        and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
        rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
        Lebanon languisheth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
        is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
        therein. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
        fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
        the rocks are thrown down by him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
        knoweth them that trust in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
        place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
        end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
        are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
        fully dry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
        LORD, a wicked counsellor. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
        yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
        Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
        thy bonds in sunder. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
        more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
        cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
        grave; for thou art vile. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
        tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
        feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
        through thee; he is utterly cut off. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
        munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
        power mightily. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
        excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
        and marred their vine branches. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
        in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
        day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
        shaken. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
        against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
        torches, they shall run like the lightnings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
        walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
        defence shall be prepared. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
        be dissolved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
        and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
        tabering upon their breasts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
        flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
        back. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
        is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
        furniture. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
        the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
        the faces of them all gather blackness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
        the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
        and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
        strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
        and his dens with ravin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
        burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
        young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
        the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
        the prey departeth not; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
        wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
        chariots. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
        glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
        great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
        corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
        harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
        through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
        discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
        thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
        vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
        shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
        bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
        rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
        the sea, and her wall was from the sea? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
        and Lubim were thy helpers. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
        children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
        streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
        her great men were bound in chains. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
        seek strength because of the enemy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
        firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
        the mouth of the eater. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
        of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
        fire shall devour thy bars. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
        into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
        off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
        many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
        the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
        grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
        when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
        known where they are. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
        dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
        and no man gathereth them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
        that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
        for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</font>
