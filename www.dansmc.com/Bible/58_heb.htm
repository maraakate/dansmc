<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
        past unto the fathers by the prophets, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
        hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
        worlds; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
        of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
        power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
        right hand of the Majesty on high: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
        inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
        Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
        him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
        world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and
        his ministers a flame of fire. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
        ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy
        kingdom. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
        God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
        the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
        old as doth a garment; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
        changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
        right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
        for them who shall be heirs of salvation? </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
        which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
        transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
        reward; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
        at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
        unto us by them that heard him; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
        and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
        according to his own will? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to
        come, whereof we speak. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
        that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
        visitest him? </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
        him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
        thy hands: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
        that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
        is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
        under him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
        for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour;
        that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
        all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
        captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
        all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
        brethren, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
        of the church will I sing praise unto thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
        the children which God hath given me. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
        blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
        through death he might destroy him that had the power of
        death, that is, the devil; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
        lifetime subject to bondage. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
        took on him the seed of Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
        his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
        priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
        the sins of the people. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
        to succour them that are tempted. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
        consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
        Jesus; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
        faithful in all his house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
        inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
        than the house. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
        things is God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant,
        for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if
        we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
        unto the end. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
        voice, </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
        temptation in the wilderness: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
        forty years. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
        do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
        of unbelief, in departing from the living God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
        any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
        of our confidence stedfast unto the end; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
        your hearts, as in the provocation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
        that came out of Egypt by Moses. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
        that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
        but to them that believed not? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
        entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
        of it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
        the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
        faith in them that heard it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
        I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
        although the works were finished from the foundation of the
        world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
        wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
        and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
        of unbelief: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
        after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear
        his voice, harden not your hearts. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
        have spoken of another day. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
        his own works, as God did from his. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
        fall after the same example of unbelief. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
        any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
        soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
        discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
        sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
        him with whom we have to do. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
        into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
        profession. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
        the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
        like as we are, yet without sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
        may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and
        sacrifices for sins: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
        out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
        infirmity. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
        himself, to offer for sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
        called of God, as was Aaron. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
        priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
        have I begotten thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
        after the order of Melchisedec. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
        and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
        was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
        feared; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
        which he suffered; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
        salvation unto all them that obey him; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
        seeing ye are dull of hearing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
        that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
        oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
        not of strong meat. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
        righteousness: for he is a babe. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:014<TD><font size=5>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
        those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
        discern both good and evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>006:001 <TD><font size=5>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
        let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
        of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:002<TD><font size=5>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
        resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:003<TD><font size=5>And this will we do, if God permit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:004<TD><font size=5>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
        have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
        the Holy Ghost, </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:005<TD><font size=5>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
        world to come, </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:006<TD><font size=5>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
        seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
        put him to an open shame. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:007<TD><font size=5>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
        it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
        dressed, receiveth blessing from God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:008<TD><font size=5>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
        nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:009<TD><font size=5>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
        things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:010<TD><font size=5>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
        love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have
        ministered to the saints, and do minister. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:011<TD><font size=5>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
        to the full assurance of hope unto the end: </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:012<TD><font size=5>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
        faith and patience inherit the promises. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:013<TD><font size=5>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
        by no greater, he sware by himself, </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:014<TD><font size=5>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I
        will multiply thee. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:015<TD><font size=5>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
        promise. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:016<TD><font size=5>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
        confirmation is to them an end of all strife. </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:017<TD><font size=5>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
        promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
        oath: </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:018<TD><font size=5>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
        God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
        for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:019<TD><font size=5>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
        stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; </font><TR><td valign=top>

006:020<TD><font size=5>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an
        high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>007:001 <TD><font size=5>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
        God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
        kings, and blessed him; </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:002<TD><font size=5>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
        interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
        of Salem, which is, King of peace; </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:003<TD><font size=5>Without father, without mother, without descent, having
        neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
        the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:004<TD><font size=5>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the
        patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:005<TD><font size=5>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
        office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
        the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
        though they come out of the loins of Abraham: </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:006<TD><font size=5>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
        of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:007<TD><font size=5>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the
        better. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:008<TD><font size=5>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth
        them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:009<TD><font size=5>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
        tithes in Abraham. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:010<TD><font size=5>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
        met him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:011<TD><font size=5>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
        under it the people received the law,) what further need was
        there that another priest should rise after the order of
        Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:012<TD><font size=5>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
        change also of the law. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:013<TD><font size=5>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
        tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:014<TD><font size=5>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
        tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:015<TD><font size=5>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
        of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:016<TD><font size=5>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
        after the power of an endless life. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:017<TD><font size=5>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
        of Melchisedec. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:018<TD><font size=5>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
        before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:019<TD><font size=5>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
        better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:020<TD><font size=5>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:021<TD><font size=5>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an
        oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
        repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
        Melchisedec:) </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:022<TD><font size=5>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:023<TD><font size=5>And they truly were many priests, because they were not
        suffered to continue by reason of death: </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:024<TD><font size=5>But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
        priesthood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:025<TD><font size=5>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
        come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
        intercession for them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:026<TD><font size=5>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
        undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
        heavens; </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:027<TD><font size=5>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
        sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:
        for this he did once, when he offered up himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

007:028<TD><font size=5>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but
        the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son,
        who is consecrated for evermore. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>008:001 <TD><font size=5>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We
        have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
        throne of the Majesty in the heavens; </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:002<TD><font size=5>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
        the Lord pitched, and not man. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:003<TD><font size=5>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and
        sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
        somewhat also to offer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:004<TD><font size=5>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing
        that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:005<TD><font size=5>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
        Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
        tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things
        according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:006<TD><font size=5>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
        much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
        established upon better promises. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:007<TD><font size=5>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
        place have been sought for the second. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:008<TD><font size=5>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
        saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house
        of Israel and with the house of Judah: </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:009<TD><font size=5>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
        in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of
        the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant,
        and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:010<TD><font size=5>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
        Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
        into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be
        to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:011<TD><font size=5>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every

        from the least to the greatest. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:012<TD><font size=5>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
        sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. </font><TR><td valign=top>

008:013<TD><font size=5>In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
        Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish
        away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>009:001 <TD><font size=5>Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
        service, and a worldly sanctuary. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:002<TD><font size=5>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
        candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called
        the sanctuary. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:003<TD><font size=5>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
        Holiest of all; </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:004<TD><font size=5>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
        overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
        that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of
        the covenant; </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:005<TD><font size=5>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of
        which we cannot now speak particularly. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:006<TD><font size=5>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
        always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:007<TD><font size=5>But into the second went the high priest alone once every
        year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
        the errors of the people: </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:008<TD><font size=5>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
        of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
        tabernacle was yet standing: </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:009<TD><font size=5>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
        offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him
        that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:010<TD><font size=5>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
        carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
        reformation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:011<TD><font size=5>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,
        by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
        that is to say, not of this building; </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:012<TD><font size=5>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
        he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
        eternal redemption for us. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:013<TD><font size=5>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
        heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
        the flesh: </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:014<TD><font size=5>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
        eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
        conscience from dead works to serve the living God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:015<TD><font size=5>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
        that by means of death, for the redemption of the
        transgressions that were under the first testament, they which
        are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:016<TD><font size=5>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
        death of the testator. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:017<TD><font size=5>For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it
        is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:018<TD><font size=5>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
        blood. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:019<TD><font size=5>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
        according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of
        goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled
        both the book, and all the people, </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:020<TD><font size=5>Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
        enjoined unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:021<TD><font size=5>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
        the vessels of the ministry. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:022<TD><font size=5>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
        without shedding of blood is no remission. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:023<TD><font size=5>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
        heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
        themselves with better sacrifices than these. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:024<TD><font size=5>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
        hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven
        itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:025<TD><font size=5>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
        entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:026<TD><font size=5>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
        the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he
        appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:027<TD><font size=5>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
        the judgment: </font><TR><td valign=top>

009:028<TD><font size=5>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
        them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
        sin unto salvation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>010:001 <TD><font size=5>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
        the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
        which they offered year by year continually make the comers
        thereunto perfect. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:002<TD><font size=5>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
        that the worshippers once purged should have had no more

        should take away sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:005<TD><font size=5>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
        and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared

        written of me,) to do thy will, O God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:008<TD><font size=5>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings

        therein; which are offered by the law; </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:009<TD><font size=5>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
        the first, that he may establish the second. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:010<TD><font size=5>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
        the body of Jesus Christ once for all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:011<TD><font size=5>And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
        oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
        sins: </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:012<TD><font size=5>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for
        ever, sat down on the right hand of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:013<TD><font size=5>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
        footstool. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:014<TD><font size=5>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
        sanctified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:015<TD><font size=5>Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
        he had said before, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:016<TD><font size=5>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
        days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,

        sin. </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:019<TD><font size=5>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
        by the blood of Jesus, </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:020<TD><font size=5>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,

010:021<TD><font size=5>And having an high priest over the house of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

010:022<TD><font size=5>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
