<center><h3>Book 31</h3><h1>OBADIAH</h1></center><HR>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
        Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
        is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
        against her in battle. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
        greatly despised. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
        dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
        that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
        ground? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
        thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
        the LORD. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
        cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
        the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
        grapes? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
        things sought up! </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
        border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
        thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
        laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
        men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
        that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
        slaughter. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
        thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
        that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
        foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
        Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
        in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
        have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
        destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
        day of distress. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
        the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
        on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
        laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
        those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
        delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
        distress. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
        hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
        upon thine own head. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
        heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
        shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
        been. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
        holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
        possessions. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
        Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
        shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
        any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
        it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
        they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
        fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
        shall possess Gilead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
        possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
        captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
        the cities of the south. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
        Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.</font>
