001:001 <TD><font size=5>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
        saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
        Jesus: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
        Lord Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
        hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
        places in Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
        the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
        in love: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
        Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
        us accepted in the beloved. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
        of sins, according to the riches of his grace; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
        to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
        gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
        heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
        predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
        things after the counsel of his own will: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
        trusted in Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
        truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
        ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
        of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
        Jesus, and love unto all the saints, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
        prayers; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
        may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
        knowledge of him: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
        know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
        the glory of his inheritance in the saints, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
        who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
        and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
        dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
        world, but also in that which is to come: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
        head over all things to the church, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
        sins; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
        world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
        spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
        the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
        and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath,
        even as others. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
        loved us, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
        with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
        heavenly places in Christ Jesus: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
        his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
        yourselves: it is the gift of God: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>Not of works, lest any man should boast. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
        works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
        them. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
        flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
        the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
        the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
        of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made
        nigh by the blood of Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
        down the middle wall of partition between us; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
        commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
        of twain one new man, so making peace; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
        cross, having slain the enmity thereby: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
        them that were nigh. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
        Father. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
        fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
        prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
        holy temple in the Lord: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
        through the Spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        is given me to you-ward: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as

        mystery of Christ) </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,

003:010<TD><font size=5>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in

004:011<TD><font size=5>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,

        measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
        carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of

        deceive; </font><TR><td valign=top>

        their mind, </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the

004:019<TD><font size=5>Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto

004:024<TD><font size=5>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
        righteousness and true holiness. </font><TR><td valign=top>

        wise, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:016<TD><font size=5>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:017<TD><font size=5>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
        the Lord is. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:018<TD><font size=5>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
        with the Spirit; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:019<TD><font size=5>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
        songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:020<TD><font size=5>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
        the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:021<TD><font size=5>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:022<TD><font size=5>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
        Lord. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:023<TD><font size=5>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
        head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:024<TD><font size=5>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
        wives be to their own husbands in every thing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:025<TD><font size=5>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
        church, and gave himself for it; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:026<TD><font size=5>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
        water by the word, </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:027<TD><font size=5>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
        having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
        be holy and without blemish. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:028<TD><font size=5>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
        loveth his wife loveth himself. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:029<TD><font size=5>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
        cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: </font><TR><td valign=top>
