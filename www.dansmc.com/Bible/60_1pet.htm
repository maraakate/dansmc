<table><tr><td valign=top>

001:001 <TD><font size=5>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
        throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:002<TD><font size=5>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
        through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
        sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
        peace, be multiplied. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:003<TD><font size=5>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
        according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
        lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:004<TD><font size=5>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
        fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:005<TD><font size=5>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
        ready to be revealed in the last time. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:006<TD><font size=5>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
        be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:007<TD><font size=5>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
        gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
        found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
        Jesus Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:008<TD><font size=5>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
        not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
        of glory: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:009<TD><font size=5>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
        souls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:010<TD><font size=5>Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
        diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
        you: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:011<TD><font size=5>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
        which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
        the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:012<TD><font size=5>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
        us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
        you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
        Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels
        desire to look into. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:013<TD><font size=5>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
        to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
        revelation of Jesus Christ; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:014<TD><font size=5>As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
        the former lusts in your ignorance: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:015<TD><font size=5>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
        manner of conversation; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:016<TD><font size=5>Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:017<TD><font size=5>And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
        judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
        sojourning here in fear: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:018<TD><font size=5>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
        corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
        conversation received by tradition from your fathers; </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:019<TD><font size=5>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
        blemish and without spot: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:020<TD><font size=5>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
        world, but was manifest in these last times for you, </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:021<TD><font size=5>Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
        dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:022<TD><font size=5>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
        through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
        that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:023<TD><font size=5>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
        incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth
        for ever. </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:024<TD><font size=5>For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
        flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
        falleth away: </font><TR><td valign=top>

001:025<TD><font size=5>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
        word which by the gospel is preached unto you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>002:001 <TD><font size=5>Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
        hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:002<TD><font size=5>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
        may grow thereby: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:003<TD><font size=5>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:004<TD><font size=5>To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
        men, but chosen of God, and precious, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:005<TD><font size=5>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
        holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
        to God by Jesus Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:006<TD><font size=5>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
        in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
        believeth on him shall not be confounded. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:007<TD><font size=5>Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
        which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed,
        the same is made the head of the corner, </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:008<TD><font size=5>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
        which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also
        they were appointed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:009<TD><font size=5>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
        nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
        praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
        marvellous light; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:010<TD><font size=5>Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
        of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
        mercy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:011<TD><font size=5>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
        abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:012<TD><font size=5>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
        whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
        good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
        visitation. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:013<TD><font size=5>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
        sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:014<TD><font size=5>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
        punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
        well. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:015<TD><font size=5>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
        silence the ignorance of foolish men: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:016<TD><font size=5>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
        maliciousness, but as the servants of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:017<TD><font size=5>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
        king. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:018<TD><font size=5>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
        to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:019<TD><font size=5>For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
        endure grief, suffering wrongfully. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:020<TD><font size=5>For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
        ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
        suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
        God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:021<TD><font size=5>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
        for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
        steps: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:022<TD><font size=5>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:023<TD><font size=5>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
        he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
        righteously: </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:024<TD><font size=5>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
        that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
        by whose stripes ye were healed. </font><TR><td valign=top>

002:025<TD><font size=5>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
        the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>003:001 <TD><font size=5>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
        that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
        be won by the conversation of the wives; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:002<TD><font size=5>While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:003<TD><font size=5>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
        the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:004<TD><font size=5>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
        not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
        which is in the sight of God of great price. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:005<TD><font size=5>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
        trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
        their own husbands: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:006<TD><font size=5>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
        ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
        amazement. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:007<TD><font size=5>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
        giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
        being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
        be not hindered. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:008<TD><font size=5>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
        another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:009<TD><font size=5>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
        contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
        that ye should inherit a blessing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:010<TD><font size=5>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
        his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:011<TD><font size=5>Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
        ensue it. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:012<TD><font size=5>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
        are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
        against them that do evil. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:013<TD><font size=5>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
        which is good? </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:014<TD><font size=5>But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
        and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:015<TD><font size=5>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
        to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
        hope that is in you with meekness and fear: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:016<TD><font size=5>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
        you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
        your good conversation in Christ. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:017<TD><font size=5>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
        well doing, than for evil doing. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:018<TD><font size=5>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
        unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
        the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:019<TD><font size=5>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:020<TD><font size=5>Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
        of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
        preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
        water. </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:021<TD><font size=5>The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
        (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
        answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
        of Jesus Christ: </font><TR><td valign=top>

003:022<TD><font size=5>Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
        angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>004:001 <TD><font size=5>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
        arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
        suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:002<TD><font size=5>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
        flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:003<TD><font size=5>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
        the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
        lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
        idolatries: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:004<TD><font size=5>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
        same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:005<TD><font size=5>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
        and the dead. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:006<TD><font size=5>For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
        are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
        flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:007<TD><font size=5>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
        and watch unto prayer. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:008<TD><font size=5>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
        for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:009<TD><font size=5>Use hospitality one to another without grudging. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:010<TD><font size=5>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
        one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:011<TD><font size=5>If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any
        man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
        giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
        Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
        Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:012<TD><font size=5>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
        is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:013<TD><font size=5>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
        sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
        glad also with exceeding joy. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:014<TD><font size=5>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
        the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part
        he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:015<TD><font size=5>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as
        an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:016<TD><font size=5>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
        but let him glorify God on this behalf. </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:017<TD><font size=5>For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
        God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
        them that obey not the gospel of God? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:018<TD><font size=5>And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
        ungodly and the sinner appear? </font><TR><td valign=top>

004:019<TD><font size=5>Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
        commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
        unto a faithful Creator. </font><TR><td valign=top>

</table><hr><table><td valign=top>005:001 <TD><font size=5>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
        and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
        of the glory that shall be revealed: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:002<TD><font size=5>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
        thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
        lucre, but of a ready mind; </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:003<TD><font size=5>Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being
        ensamples to the flock. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:004<TD><font size=5>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
        crown of glory that fadeth not away. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:005<TD><font size=5>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
        all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
        humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
        humble. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:006<TD><font size=5>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
        he may exalt you in due time: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:007<TD><font size=5>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:008<TD><font size=5>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
        roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:009<TD><font size=5>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
        afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
        world. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:010<TD><font size=5>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
        glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
        make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:011<TD><font size=5>To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:012<TD><font size=5>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
        written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
        true grace of God wherein ye stand. </font><TR><td valign=top>

005:013<TD><font size=5>The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
        saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. </font><TR><td valign=top>
