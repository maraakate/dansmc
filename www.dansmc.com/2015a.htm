<center><H1>2015 Jihad 101</H1></center>

<P><font size=4>With the sad events in France I feel compelled to make a few comments. Everyone says these are the acts of a small segment of Muslim society yet there is little condemnation from these most peaceful peoples. There is some but not enough.

<P>There seem to be a lot of misconceptions about Islamic intentions. One group says, in all truthfulness, that Islam is a religion of peace and love. However, virtually all the attacks in recent memory are made by Muslims. Where is the truth?

<P>How can this, seemingly, contradiction be? There is an interesting concept in the Islamic religion called "Naskh" also known as "Abrogation". This basically means what comes after overwrites what comes before. So if I make a law- "You can't kill people" I can change that law later to "You can kill people". The principle of Abrogation allows you to do this. To top it all off the Quran is not in chronological order but is arranged with the shortest suras (chapters) first. 

<P>Yeah, I know. Weird. 

<P>All this is important because the newer Suras are from Muhammad's violent later days when he was in Medina. They override the older ones from his time in Mecca when he was more peaceful. So newer Suras override older ones. That means Muhammad's peaceful words are over written by his violent words. Got that?

<P>Once you understand this things start to make sense. Well, maybe not much but a bit. The peaceful Muslims are only reading the oldest Suras. The violent terrorist Muslims are reading the later, newer Suras. As you might think the terrorist Muslims think they are the true followers of Islam and they feel free to kill just about everyone that they think disagrees with them and that their god will reward them for doing it.

<P>It always made me wonder. If you die for Islam and you get all this good stuff, virgins and whatnot, why are all the Imams and Islamic leaders not pushing their way to the front of the line? You can bet, just like leaders everywhere, they are living in the best rooms here, so why are they sending young men and women to blow themselves up. One would think if they really believed, they would go first. Sort of lead the way, so to speak. Just sayin'?

<P>There is another problem that pops up. Jihad. To the Muslim extremist Jihad is, as Taqi Nabhani states, "a war against anybody who opposes the Islamist call." Now once we, in and of our selves, decide what is "the Islamist call" things can get nasty real fast. You see this in all the bombings and murders that the Muslims commit on each other. It is OK to kill people who oppose your version of the "Islamist call" even if they are Muslim because they have become "kuffar". This is really squirrelly stuff and if you use your imagination you can rationalize anything you want to do.

Did you know one of the policeman murdered in France was Muslim? Well, he was. I guess he was just not Islamic enough for the radical Muslims who killed him.

<P>Another thing about Jihad and that something is "taqiyya" which is lying to get what you want during war. What the person who answers the Islamist call is doing is Jihad. That is war and in war you can lie, cheat, steal, and most anything else to further your cause. After all, you are fighting against people who are "kuffar". Kuffar are dirty, disgusting, icky, people who do not believe in Islam or at least your own personal brand of it.

<P>This is what our leaders seem incapable of understanding. There are many peaceful Muslims in the world BUT, and this is important, they are not following their religion's true teachings. Because of the Muslim principle of Abrogation the extremists are the only ones truly following Islam as taught in the Koran. 

<P>So now I have to ask the this question. If a Muslim scholar now tells me I am wrong how can I believe him? I and probably you too are considered kuffar and it is legal to lie to me/us. You see the problem? Hmm, maybe they ARE following the Koran.

<P>If you want to study this further read the book "The Islamist" by Ed Husain. He chronicles his own history becoming a Islamic fundamentalist starting at age fifteen in the mid 1990s. After five years he left radical Islam. His book gives you a good view of Radical Islamic ideas. 

<P>An interesting thing came to my mind as I was reading his book. I was having <a href="http://www.dansmc.com/D&amp;" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=628,height=270,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;">D&#233;j&#224; vu</A>. The things he describes, while new to him were really a very old, familiar tune to me. I have heard that song before. It is all about "Control". The people at the top of the heap demanded everyone obey their rules except, of course, themselves. Same old, same old. Be it a dictator, be it a king, be it the progressives, be it the communists, be it the caliphate, be it socialism, be it whoever or whatever. They all want mandatory control over us but they never want to be part of it or be held accountable.

<P>Then I think how different Jesus is when compared to all the others. He has done all the work for you because he knows you cannot do it yourself. All you have to do is believe in him and that is it.

<P><B>Jesus</B> tells us in John 3:16-21

<P><B>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
<P> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
<P> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
<P> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
<P> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
<P> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."</B>

<P>Islam requires five daily prayers. Which Mr. Husain says the radicals often missed. 
<P><B>Jesus</B> says:


<P><B> "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
 <P>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
<P>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
<P>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
 After this manner therefore pray ye: 

<p>Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
"</B>

<P>But perhaps the most important part (if you ignore the gift of eternal life) is that there is no Abrogation in the Bible. <B>Jehovah</B> is <B>NOT</B> allah. He gets it right the first time and does not need to change anything. In fact Hebrews 13:8 tells us: 
<P><B>"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."</B>

<P><B>Jesus</B> says in Revelations 1:8 

<P><B>"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."</B>

<P>Remember that <B>Jesus</B> said he <B>IS</B> God. 
<P>John 10:30: <B>"I and my Father are one."</B>

<P>Please remember too what the Apostle John wrote in Revelation 22:18 and 19:

<P><B>"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

<P>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."</B>

<P>Those are some pretty heavy duty words. You will notice something. All you have to do is believe in <B>Jesus</B>. Then he gives you freedom AND eternal life.

 <P><B>Jesus</B> tells us:

<P><B>"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."</B> John 8:32

<P>and again in John 8:36 

<P><B>"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."</B>

<P>Notice that <B>Jesus</B> is taking care of all this. He does not need my help. That is why Christians will not shoot you or blow you up if you insult <B>Jesus.</B> He is perfectly able to defend himself. Why? Because he is real. He lives today and he will save you from your sins. All you have to do is believe.


<P><font size=6><B>Jesus</B> gives you the freedom to choose. Just remember, if you choose to reject him it is a true free choice and you are choosing an eternity without Jehovah God and your choice will be honored.</font>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
