<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4> President Trump has just returned from his first foreign trip. He did a superb job. We finally have a President who will led from the front. <font size=5><B>AND</B></Font><font size=4> we are out of that Paris Climate Accord thing on global cooling... no, that is so 1970. It was global warming... no, that is so 2000. Wait, oh yes, it's now climate change, otherwise known as weather. You know, if they can't get the weather for next weekend right why do you think they can forecast the weather in thirty years, right? Just so much Fake News. However, look on the bright side for Liberal Progressives. Al Gore and his friends have made a ton of money on this BS.

<P>The <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/06/21/inside-the-jealous-feud-between-the-obamas-and-hildebeest-clintons/" target="_blank">Hildabeest</A> is back it seems, spouting her bile. She might want to not rock the boat so much. Whatever anyone says, the fact still remains, she had Secret and Top Secret e-mails on her unsecured server and that is a violation of the law. Whether or not she is prosecuted. Here are just a few I got from <a href="http://www.hannity.com/articles/election-493995/heres-the-list-of-the-laws-14019612/" target="_blank">Sean Hannity's web site.</A>

<P>He is not the only one. How about the <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/09/27/yes-hillary-clinton-broke-the-law/" target="_blank">New York Post</A> or the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/414777/yes-hillary-clinton-broke-law-ian-tuttle" target="_blank">National Review</A>.

<P>As one man said to his friend. "The system needs to be fixed." His friend replied, "How much more fixed can it be?"

<P>Yea, Hil, keep rock'n that boat. 

<P>"That is why, after vigorously opposing Trump's candidacy during the Republican primaries, I vigorously supported him once he won the nomination. I believed then, as I do now, that America was doomed if a Democrat had been elected president. With the Supreme Court and hundreds of additional federal judgeships in the balance; with the Democrats' relentless push toward European-style socialism -- completely undoing the unique American value of limited government; the misuse of the government to suppress conservative speech; the continuing degradation of our universities and high schools; the weakening of the American military; and so much more, America, as envisioned by the Founders, would have been lost, perhaps irreversibly. The "fundamental transformation" that candidate Barack Obama promised in 2008 would have been completed by Hillary Clinton in 2016.


<P>To my amazement, no anti-Trump conservative writer sees it that way. They all thought during the election, and still think, that while it would not have been a good thing if Hillary Clinton had won, it wouldn't have been a catastrophe either.

<P>That's it, in a nutshell. Many conservatives, including me, believe that it would have been close to over for America as America if the Republican candidate, who happened to be a flawed man named Donald Trump, had not won. Moreover, I am certain that only Donald Trump would have defeated Hillary Clinton.

<P>In other words, I believe that Donald Trump may have saved the country. And that, in my book, covers a lot of sins -- foolish tweets, included." 

<P>The above are the words of <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/dennisprager/2017/05/30/why-conservatives-still-attack-trump-n2332924?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=" target="_blank">Dennis Prager</A> and they capture my thoughts perfectly. I still hope we, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, alike can all come together and reason together but my hope is fading fast. I and other deplorables, like myself, will not go back to the progressive socialism that has been destroying our country for the last eight years. 

<P>Plus, if you actually are worried about the Russians, <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2017/06/01/judicial-watch-finds-new-clinton-emails-showing-huma-abedin-hooking-up-russians-n2334900" target="_blank">Judicial Watch</A> found Hilary was selling favors to a Russian connected organization by way of the Clinton Foundation when she was Secretary of State.
<P>

<P>Wow, we now find that former FBI director James Comey states, under oath, that he was not investigating President Trump. Comey also leaked information to the press through a friend. That took a lot of courage. Do you think that friend might need a lawyer? Then Comey says he changed the name of Hildabeest's e-mail "investigation" to "matter" per Loretta Lynch's request but could not say he would be loyal to President Trump. Is it any wonder President Trump fired him? I'll bet all the Democrats thrust their fists in the air and shouted 'YES" when they first heard. Of course, then they changed that yes to a no.

<P>I vividly remember telling people at the beginning of Bill Clinton's presidency, that we need to back our president and give him a chance even if we disagreed with him. I was the Loyal opposition yet Comey could not be loyal to the President. Not a very good Boy Scout, as some have called Comey. Guess he forgot what the <a href="http://www.boyscouttrail.com/boy-scouts/scout-oath.asp" target="_blank">Boy Scout Oath</a> taught.

<P>Realclear politics approval poll has President Trump's approval on day 138 of his presidency at 39.8 compared to the "I did not have sex with that woman" President Clinton's at 37.8 for the same day of his presidency. Maybe people are starting to put all this BS behind us.

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
