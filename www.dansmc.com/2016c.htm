<font size=5 face=tahoma><B>&#182;</font><font size=4> Well, we won. We beat the Republican establishment. We beat the Democrats. We beat the lying, in the bag for Hillary, alphabet national press. The <B>AMERICAN PEOPLE WON.</<>

<P>For the last couple of months I have worn my Trump Hat every time I went to town. Except for one or two yard signs and a bumper sticker, I saw no one else pushing Trump but I did get a lot of pro Trump comments. Just one anti Trump comment but she said she did not like Hillary either. I didn't see many Hillary signs either. Couple bumper sticker and a couple yard signs. Go figure.

<p>I'm am the Chief Election Judge for Precinct 61 in my county. We had over 825 voters and many, many new voters registered to vote on November 8th. In 2012 We had around 630 voters and not half as many new registrants. We had a lot of mail in voters too. This year we had the biggest voter turn out we have ever had. A good thing. A very good thing. Now we need to get rested up. The real work begins next year.

<P><center><font size=7><B>We Voted for America. <BR>We Voted for Donald Trump <BR>and America Won.</B></font></center>

<BR><BR>

<center><font size=7>UPDATE</font><BR>11-15-2016</center>


<P>So now we have the losers, most of whom did not vote, marching and in some instances rioting, in the streets. What a joke. All these people's opinions are simply irrelevant. Their ideas are proven failures. Obamacare is failing, our immigration policy is a failure, our national budget(?) is a failure, economy is bad. King, oops, I mean President Obama's policies are a total failure. Yet these people wanted a criminal, Hillery Clinton, to lead them in a third Obama term.

<P>You know what? That is OK! 

<P>Why is that OK? This is the United States of America. It is OK to have wrong, goofy ideas here as long as you don't hurt anyone while expressing those wrong, goofy ideas. 

<P>All of the protests are OK with me because they are all irrelevant. As President Obama said "Elections have consequences." He had his chance, blew it. When he won, I did <B>NOT</B> march in the strees against him. Even though I knew he was wrong. Now it is our turn and we will Make America Great Again. 

<P>But back to the protests. They are simply irrelevant. They don't count for anything. If a weasel sits outside your backyard fence and calls you bad, nasty names and tells lies about you do you listen? Do you even care that the weasel is there? No. You only care if the weasel tries to harm you or one of your friends. Then a shotgun cures your problem.

<P>So I say go for it and march and complain all you want. Your Ideas are totally Irrelevant. Just remember this, if you try to drag me out of my car. "Sticks and stones may break my bones but Hollow Points expand on impact".



<BR><center><img src="wrench5.gif"></center><BR>

<center><font size=7>ANOTHER UPDATE</font><BR>11-20-2016</center>

<P>Can you believe this? I personally took this screen shot off of Craigslist today. Your tax dollars and union dues at work. Paid protesters for the Hildabeast and progressive outrage. I'll bet if they paid extra they could get some real tears too. All spontaneous protests by the outraged public, but of course.

<P>It is still OK with me. Like Newt said in Alians <a href="http://movie-sounds.org/quotes/aliens/It-wont-make-any-difference.mp3" target="_blank">"It won't make any difference."</A>

<P><br><center><a href="stop_trump_2_11-20-16.gif" target="_blank"><img src="stop_trump_2_11-20-16.gif" alt="Craigslist Ad"  width=500 height=339 border=0></A></center>

<BR><center><img src="wrench5.gif"></center><BR>

<center><font size=7>WOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, ANOTHER UPDATE</font><BR>12-15-2016</center>

<P>This year just keeps getting better and better. Trump won, Castro died, and I am actually getting E-mails from people who disagree with me. Unfortunately, they still are not very specific. They do say I'm a bad Christian and a bad Christian witness for backing Trump. Trump is insane, Trump is a narcissist, I guess as opposed to our present king-in-chief ??? Really? However, still no real proof that I can sink my teeth into except to tell me that I need to watch PBS more. Oh yes, one more thing. <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/edklein/2016/12/14/comey-to-trump-the-russians-didnt-influence-the-election-n2259827?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=" target="_blank">The Russians did it. </A>

<P>As far as that goes, all the security agencies are running away from that one so they don't get pinned down with the facts. I get hit with the same hack that got someone into the e-mails of <a href="http://theresurgent.com/this-2-keystroke-error-is-why-clinton-deserved-to-lose/" target="_blank">John Podesta</A>, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, about twice a month. I just delete those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank">Phishing E-mails</A> and I never have any problems. Do you think the Russians are after me too? Maybe not. You know folks, any Geeky kid with a laptop can get on the internet at most any Library or McBerger restaurant, use a free webproxy website and begin Phishing you. It will be, basically, impossible to track him down. I say basically because maybe the NSA can track down the camera footage, from the McBerger parking lot cameras and get his license plate number. Who knows?

<P>Still, I very happy all these people E-mailed me. Thank You! I do read every one.

<P>Michael Goodwin says "The American system itself is in for biggest change in our lifetime and a lot of people simply don't want this change. They are invested in the status quo. They profit from the status quo. They are the architects of the status quo. They don't want the change that Donald Trump represents."

<P>This change is going to be good for the United States of America. As columnist Laura Hollis points out "Those who've grown fat and happy doing things the "old way" will resist the "new way" with everything they've got -- even when the "new way" turns out to be better for them. Disney was one of the plaintiffs who sued Sony to try to stop the sales of Betamax recorders. Thank goodness they lost. Can you imagine Disney today without the obscene revenue streams generated by videocassettes and DVDs?"


<P>Bottom line, as President Obama said, "Elections have consequences." So keep writing those E-mails but you need to accept that Donald Trump won the Presidency. Cry me a river. Build me a bridge, and get over it.

<P>Today is <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16046" target="_blank">Bill of Rights Day.</a> The first 10 amendments were adopted 225 years ago on Dec. 15, 1791.

<center><h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS TO ME<BR></H1></center>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!
