<P>My daughter sent me a YouTube music video. I liked it! It has a nice beat to it.

<P>I was watching some gal on TV say that she would submit to the STA groping her so she could be safe flying. I have to wonder. The <a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> says there were 33,808 people killed on the Nations roads in 2009. That is over 11 9/11s that are happening every single year in the USA.

<P>All the surveys I have read about fatal auto crash injuries say about 60-70% of the deaths were caused by head injuries. So well over 20,000 people would be saved each year if only they (the government) would require every car driver and passenger to wear a motorcycle helmet. Good luck trying to get your mother, wife, or girl friend to wear a helmet several times a day. Hello helmet hair!

<P>We put up with these auto deaths because it is very handy to get in your car and go somewhere quickly. The risk just isn't that great. I guess that gal must enjoy getting groped but I sure don't. The risk of a bomb on that jet just is not that great. However, the government has convinced everyone that a lie is truth. The lie is our risk on those planes. It just not much of a risk. Way to go TSA!

<center>Here are some Spec's from 1999-2003<BR><BR><img src="accident1.jpg"></center>
<BR>

<P>Moving on...

<P>Ben Bernanke, at a recent banking conference, was asked if he had any estimate of the cost of new federal regulations to the economy and he said it was too complicated to estimate. Yeah, right, sure. Maybe you might be wondering exactly how all these regulations are killing our economy. Let me tell you a true story.

<P>Back in early 2007 a man from Sweden wanted a bear rug. It took me quite a bit of time to learn how to LEGALLY ship it to him. The big problem was getting what is known as a Cites permit. You can't legally ship a bear rug to another country without it. I give the Federal Government $100 and they say it not an endangered bear (As if Idaho Fish & Game has not already guaranteed that. There is a numbered pelt tag on each legally taken Idaho bear.) and that I can ship it. Provided, of course, I get an Import/Export license ($150) and a export permit ($50). This all took about 60 days and everyone was quite pleasant to work with. 

<P>Fast forward to 2010. A business man in South Korea wanted to buy a bear rug to resell to his customers in South Korea. I put in all the paper work EXACTLY the same way I did with the Swedish bear. I wait 90 days. Nothing. I call and e-mail the Cites people who tell me a Biologist is working on it. I ask if they need anything more. They say no. Then a day or two later I get a nasty e-mail DEMANDING some more information and a THREAT that if I don't send it within a certain time they would void the permit and I would lose my $100. I call and e-mail them back with the info and I am told OK but there are twenty people ahead of me, the Biologist working my permit only works three days a week and they would e-mail me when the permit was issued. What she did the other two days I don't know. Perhaps she counted how many <a href="http://www.theresilientearth.com/?q=content/wind-power-green-and-deadly">endangered birds were killed</A> by wind turbines in all those new green energy wind farms.
<P>More e-mails and more calls later still nothing. I finally contact one of my state Senators and ask him to look into it. That sure got the ball rolling. A week later the Cites people finally sent the permit, without e-mailing me as they had promised. They also sent a letter to the senator saying all the hold up was my fault. To top it off everyone I dealt with, except for the state Senator, was arrogant and irritated that I was bothering them.

<P>So over six months after I started I was finally able to send the bear to Korea. The business man had ordered a bear from Canada at the same time he ordered a bear from me. The Canadian bear got to him, with a Canadian Cites permit, a month after he ordered it. My bear was cheaper but with a six month wait... who do you think he is going to order future bear rugs from? Not me, that's for sure.

<P>So let's recap. No way am I going to sell another bear to anyone over seas. It is just not worth the stress even if I could find someone willing to risk a $1000 plus government fees. So I lose $1000 for the bear and the US Government lost about $300 in fees. All this money was coming from OUTSIDE the USA and President Obama wonders why we are going broke! Oh yes, just in case you didn't know. Cites permits are only good for six months so it is not smart to get a permit before I have a buyer. Yes, Bernanke was talking about banking regulations but all new regulations are at fault. Like we didn't have enough before? At least there is some good news. Canada is doing great!

<center><h1>E-MAIL YOUR COMMENTS TO ME<BR></H1></center>

<BR>
<P><font size=4>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE Palin, Beck, O'Reilly, Fox,  ETC. They are just liar, liar pants on fire. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!

<P>One last thing. This is for comments on my Blobs only. No motorcycle questions because I'm not writing back from this E-Mail address. OK? 

<P>If you have motorcycle questions click the motorcycle <a href="emailtome.htm"><img src="cr125r.gif" width=50 height=30 border=0></A> and follow my rules.
