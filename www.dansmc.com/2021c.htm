<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> As I watch our First and Second Amendment and other constitutional rights being stolen from us. 
<P> As I watch our Citizenship being stolen from us by Illegal aliens. <P> As I watch the Fraudster-in-Chief <img class="expando cat" border="0" src="biden4.gif" width="15" height="20"> and the Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B> destroying our Republic, I can't help but believe we are in the last days. 

<P> But enough of this talk. Let us talk about something useful. Back in 1971 I joined the United States Army and enlisted for Airborne school and Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic school. Most enlistees were poor and had low draft numbers. If you were drafted, you went in for two years. If, like me, you enlisted, you went in for three years. 

<P> Talk about equality. We were all <font size=5 color=green><B>GREEN</B></font>. Green shirt. Green pants, Green hat, <font color=green><B>GREEN</B></font>. We all looked the same. We all got paid the same too. We all had the same rank, Private. The lowest of the low. We were all as equal as you can get. 

<P>Now, fast forward a year. A large number of my fellow soldiers are now flat broke. They have basically nothing. No money, except what the army pays them each month and that quickly disappears. No physical things except a state of the art stereo system. Others have money in the bank and a start on a fruitful life. What happened? We were all equal and yet now some have a lot more then others. So what is the difference between these two groups that started out so equal? At least equal economically. Culturally? Well that is another thing entirely.

<P> In my sociology and anthropology classes in collage we studied different Cultures. Wikipedia defines Culture as "an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society." All of my college teachers told us that while many Cultures were different from each other, they were all basically equal. Which is, of course, total hog feces. Some Cultures are good, some are bad, and some are horrible. It depends on the Norms or Mores of each Culture. Norms and Mores are the customs of a group people.

<P>So where do Cultural Norms or Mores come from? They come from two different sources. God or man. I'm not going into too much detail on man made Mores. They are pretty much a disaster wherever they are exclusively applied. look at places that apply man made mores. Most recent is former Capitalist, now socialist, Venezuela. Chile is now following. Then there is Russia, China, most all of Africa, I could go on and on but I won't. We need to look at something that works. That leaves us with God. God or, more accurately, Jesus made us so it stands to reason Jesus would know what works best for us. 

<P>As I write this, I am watching the TV show "I (almost) got away with it." You know, the crooks always think "I'm a lot smarter then the police", but they never are. Same thing with communists and socialists. They think they are so smart, but they are not. Their polices, man's mores, <B><U>NEVER</U></B> work.

<P> Coming back to my fellow Paratroopers. I saw something very interesting. If you followed good mores your economic position went up. Slowly but surely up. So what are these Mores? Look in the Bible. Let me list some of them for you.

<P><LU>
<LI> A belief in Jesus.
<LI> A belief in the Golden Rule. Matthew 7:12 "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdo to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."
<LI> A belief in Freedom for everyone, not just your group. If it's not good for everyone, it's good for no &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspone.
<LI> A belief in the <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/capitalism-in-three-principles/" target="_blank">Principals of Capitalism</A>, which are:
<OL>
<LI>Division of labor
<LI>Impersonal exchange based on prices
<LI>Growth based on economies of scale
</OL>
<LI> A belief in Work.
<LI> A belief in telling the Truth.
<LI> A belief in Obeying the Law.
<LI> A belief in Keeping Your Word.
<LI> A belief in Self Discipline and Patience.
<LI> A belief in not Stealing Things.
<LI> A belief in the Sanctity of Marriage.
<LI> A belief in being Reliable.
<LI> A belief in Honoring your Father and your Mother.
<LI> A belief in Helping Others.
<LI> A belief in Saving Money. Do not spend every nickel you make. <a href="nickel_dollar.htm" target="_blank">Turn that nickel into a dollar</A>.
<LI> A belief in not Getting Drunk. There is quite a difference between a beer on Friday night and falling &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdown drunk.
<LI> A belief in not using Hard Drugs.
<LI> A belief in not having Sex with every Tom, Dick, and Julia you meet. Sexually transmitted diseases &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreally hurt. Some of them have no cure.



</LU>
<p> I'm sure you can add more to the list. The point being Cultures that adhere to these mores produce a better lifestyle for their members at every level of that Culture, from poor to rich. No matter what anyone says a high tide does indeed float all boats. But you have to have a boat in the water to float higher. 

<P> Cultures and people that follow these rules move up the economic ladder. The more you follow these beliefs the better you will do in life. Prove it to your self. Get a world map and look where the "rich" countries are and where the "poor" counties are. The "rich" countries are not "rich" because of natural recourses but because they are following these principles and mores.

<P> Look at Africa. There are many places where diamonds are found but the people in those places are poor because their Cultures do not follow these principles. Notice this too. These principles and mores will work for rich or poor, black or white or any other skin color, race, creed or nationality. I saw this happen many times in the army. Follow Biblical principles and you will thrive and get ahead in all things in your life. Follow poor values and mores, like those common to communistic societies, socialistic societies, inner city societies and you will always be doomed to live on the lower economic tracks.

<P>If you think about it, these mores are not white privilege, like the "woke" Democ<font size=5><B>rats</B></font> say. They are Biblical privilege and these privileges are open to, and will work for, <B><U>anyone</U></B> who wants to use them. That is the trick though, you have got to commit to and use these mores. You can't break the law by sneaking over the border and then claim to be law abiding. You can't obey the law only when it benefits you and then break it when it suits you. The same with all the other mores. As Yoda said "Do or do not, there is no try."  

<P>If you commit to these mores and stay true to them you will receive their benefits. If you don't, you will loose their benefits. That's just the way it is.

<center><h2><B>UPDATE! <BR> 2021<BR></B></H2></center>


<P><font size=4>Well, I give up. No one ever sends me any comments that disagree with my comments. No noth'en, nada, zip, zero, nothing. I am sorry to say but it must be true. The Progressive Democrats have based all they say on NOTHING. Oh well, you can still E-mail me.


<P>
<strike>OK, How do I say this without being offensive. I am really interested in what you say but I don't give a flying passage of gas in a hot place about what you think!
<P>WOW, what does that mean? Simply this. I am interested in what you say about the things I say and you can tell the truth to me because you can't offend me. That is because I don't care about what you think of me! You can FLAME me, Rant and Rave, say you love me or say you hate me, it's all the same to me!

<P>I am interested in how you come to whatever opinion you have, why you say what you say. Lately, I keep hearing and reading about people who say they HATE, absolutely HATE President Trump and the deplorable people who voted for him. They are just liar, liar pants on fire and they kill little puppies too. However, they never seem to be able to give proof or at least some kind of reason for what they say. I gave you reasons why I feel as I do so if you disagree with me can you give me some reason why?

<P>So there you go. Tell me what you think. I promise to read what you say but I will not write back because I don't care what you think. I only care about what you say!</strike>
