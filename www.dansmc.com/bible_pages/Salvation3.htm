<font face="tahoma" size=4>

<P>Many people say "What about some one who would believe in Jesus but has never heard about him. How can they be saved with out hearing about Jesus?" A good question if you are really concerned about an unsaved person. Unfortunately, many people use that question as a reason not to believe in Jesus. They say "I can't believe in a God who would send someone to Hell" If you consider the true nature of God and what God wants for us, this attitude is ridiculous. John 3:16 tells us <B>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</B> God made us and he knows all about us, warts and all. Jesus died for us and he is not willing that <B>"any should parish"</B> (2Peter 3:9). 

<P>Psalms 19:1 says<B> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork." </B>Romans 1:20 tells us<B> "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse".</B> What this means is that it is obvious that someone made the natural world and that someone is God. </B>

<P>If anyone, anywhere, goes walking and stumbles onto a house with a bed in it and windows and all the other things that make up a house, that anyone knows that someone built that house. Anyone in the world will know that there is a God simply by looking around themselves. They may have trouble giving him a name but they do know there is a God who made the world.

<P>There is another thing that everyone seems to forget. God is good! Luke 18:19 <B>"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God."</B>
<BR><BR>
<P>What does all this mean? Well, I think it means this. If there is a way for an individual person to be saved, God will find it. God loves each and every one of us more then anyone else can. He loves you more then your mother, father. More then your husband or wife. 

<P>I just don't worry about other people. My job is to tell others about Jesus Christ and what he has done for me. It is God's business to do the actual saving. He allows me to help him just like a father lets his little son help him. He does not necessarily need my help. Acts 2:21 says <B>"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."</B>  

<P>So remember, God is good and he loves you more than anyone else can. Trust him and believe what he says. Don't get sidetracked worrying about whether or not others get saved. If there is any possible way to save them God will find it! Also remember, There is a flip side to this worrying about other people and that is we forget to worry about ourselves. 

<P>I just watched an interview with a man that won $48.6 million in one of the state lotteries in the USA. He said he prayed to the gods that if he won he would devote his time to teaching the wiccan religion, which believes in many gods, to people. He attributed his win to these gods. The interviewer seemed to  make fun of his beliefs, however, I believe him. 

<P>The prince of this world is the devil. He is as Ephesians 2:2 states 
<P><B> "... the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"</B>
<P> Jesus said about him in John 14:30 
<P><B>"... for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me."</B> 
<P>Because the devil has power in this world he can give people great reward and tempt them just like he tempted Jesus in Matthew 4:8-10 
<P><B>"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."</B>
<P>This man, who I imagine has had the gospel presented to him many times, has chosen foolishly. Jesus said in Matthew 16:26:
<P><B>"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</B>
<P>If you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and trust in him and only him for your salvation you will be saved. In fact you are saved as of right now! You have had the gospel presented to you. It is real simple and easy to understand. You are not in a mud hut in the middle of the Amazon jungle. You have a very real and clear choice. What will it be?

<P>Some people reject Jesus and <a href="go_to_hell.htm"><B>choose</B></A> to be lost. Don't be one of them!
