<hr>
<p><font face=tahoma size=4>Here again, I wonder why this question is so hard to answer. It seems another no brainier to me. God sends no one to Hell. We send ourselves. Huh ? The Bible tells us in 2nd Peter 3:9

<P><B>"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."</B> 

<P>God wants a close, loving, relationship, with all men and women. However, we do have the right to choose. You can choose wisely or foolishly, but to be a real choice that choice has to stick. That's the thing everyone seems to forget. If I tell you that you have a choice, either yes or no, and you choose the answer I don't like, I have to let your choice stand. If I don't, then you never really had a choice, did you ?

<P>God gives you freedom, part of this freedom is freedom of choice. With this freedom of choice comes responsibility. You have the responsibility for your own choice... right ?

<P>Jesus says in Matthew 25:41 

<P><font color=red>"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: "</font>.

<P> Notice that he says <font color=red>"Prepared for the devil and his angels"</font> God made the fire for the devil and his angels, not for man. God <font color=red>NEVER</font> meant for any man or women to go there. We choose to go there and God is forced to honor our choice. The good news is that we don't have to join the devil and his angels ! God has provided us a way to avoid the fire. All we have to do is <B>Choose</B> to believe in Jesus.

<P>Jesus tells us in John 3:16 

<P><B>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</B>



<P>We need to say to God what Joshua said thousands of years ago. 

<P><B>(Joshua 24:15) "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."</B>


<P>Even today we dwell in the land of the Amorites ( The land of unbelievers ). We need to choose who we will serve. Be Careful, God will honor that choice. The <B>CHOICE</B> is with you !

<P><font size=5><B>"... as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."</B></font>
