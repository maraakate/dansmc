<hr>
<p><font face=tahoma size=4>I wonder why this question was so hard to answer. It seems a no brainer to me. If we read the book of Ecclesiastes, in the Old Testament, we find an account written by Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived. He searched for the meaning of life. He was the richest and most powerful man of his day. He decided to do absolutely ANYTHING he wanted to, and do he did. He built all kinds of stuff. Buildings, houses, stables, all kind
s of things. He had 1000 wives and concubines. Wow, I get tired just thinking about it ! He was the most powerful king of his day. Other monarchs came to him for help and advice.

<P>He said he tried anything and everything to make himself happy. He found that it was all worthless, all vanity. None of it made him happy. He said, in Ecclesiastes 12:13, 

<P>"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." Now what does that mean ? Obey the commandments of God, well duh ! What are the commandments ? Jesus answered this question for us. In Matthew 22:36 a lawyer asked "Master, which is the great commandment in the law ? Jesus said unto him, 

<P><font color=red>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</font>" 

<P>Kind of simple, don't you think ?

<P>I think we can add the Ten Commandments. Love God, Don't murder, don't lie, don't covet, obey your parents. Really radical stuff this, but Jesus gave even more radical orders. He says in Matthew 5:44 to Love your enemies. Do good to your enemies. Absolutely outrageous stuff. When people who do not believe in Jesus Christ call people who do believe in Jesus, and the Bible, "Terrorists" and "Hateful" and "Intolerant", I have to wonder exactly where do they get their information. 

<P>Does God hate sin ? Absolutely, but he loves men and women and has provided a way for them to be forgiven of their sins and reconciled to himself. That way is belief in Jesus Christ and his finished work on the cross. John 3:16 says 

<P><font color=red>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</font> 

<P>In John 14:6 Jesus states, 

<P><font color=red>"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</font>" 

<P>Jesus also said to go out to all the world and spread the good news of eternal life through him. Look at what Matthew 28:18-20 says 

<P>"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <font color=red>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</font>"


<P>Bottom line ? If you are a believer in Jesus there is only one reason for you to be here, and that is to obey God's commandments and spread the good news about Jesus to those who do not know it. Anything else is vanity.
