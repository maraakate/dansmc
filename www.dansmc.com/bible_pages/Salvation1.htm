<font face="tahoma" size=4>

<P>I find it interesting that in every culture and every age people seem to think they will get into Heaven if their good deeds outweigh their bad deeds. What does God say? Well, Romans 3:10-12 says: 

<P><B>"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."</B>

<P>That kinda of covers it. What part of "NONE" do we not understand? The Apostle Paul adds:

<P><B>"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</B>(Ephesians 2:8-9)

<P>Now if that doesn't convince you that <B>YOU</B> can't do it yourself how about this from Isaiah 64:6

<P><B>"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."</B>

<P>In the original Hebrew, "filthy rags", means they are soaked with menstrual blood. Yuck! That is pretty bad. Again, what part of "ALL" do we not understand?

<P>The Apostle Paul says something else too:

<P>(Romans 7:19-25) <B>"or the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."</B>

<P>So what can we do to be accepted by God? 

Apostle Paul tells us in Acts 16:30-31

<P><B>"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."</B>

<P>That's it! Belief plus nothing. Belief in Jesus Christ and his finished work on the cross. 

<P>This one seems like another "No Brainer" but I guess they all are. The Bible spells it out quite plainly. The Bible says in Hebrews 12:2

<P><B>"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."</B>

<p>What this means is that Jesus did it all. The only real thing we have to do with our salvation is accept it. This is something we don't want to hear. We like to think we have it all together and under control, but the truth is... we don't! We can't do it ourselves. We need a Savior and his name is <B>Jesus Christ</B>.
