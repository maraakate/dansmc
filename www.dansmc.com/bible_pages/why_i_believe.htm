<hr>
<p><font face=tahoma size=4>I see that there is a very large body of hard facts that prove, quite convincingly, the validity of the words of Jesus and the Bible. Thousands of books and millions of words have been written about this. I'm not going to rehash all that here. No, I think I will cover some things no one seems to consider.

<OL>
<P><LI>Have you ever noticed ? When people curse, they usually say something like "Jesus Christ, that hurt" or "Christ !" I never hear them say "Oh Saddam" or "Ben Lodden, that hurt" or "OH MY HITLER". If Jesus was just a common man or even a great man like Lincoln or Gandhi or Churchill, why is it so common to hear his name used as a swear word ? Do you think it could be because He is something more ?

<P><LI>A guy just e-mailed me and was he MAD ! He said "But Dan, what has the Bible got to do with
motorcycles? Oh right, nothing. Enough said." He then used four paragraphs to inform me that I was wrong to put anything about God on a motorcycle site. Another guy linked to me but said I was  "Annoyingly religious." Now I have never done a word count but, I would guess about 95 % of my site does not mention Jesus at all ! 

<P>I give my Motorcycle Repair Course away for free. A mail order motorcycle repair course costs $600.00-$1,000.00 or more. If the Church of Scientology, who's beliefs are totally different from mine, gave away something worth $600 dollars I would grab it in a minute and if they preached a bit at me it would not bother me at all. I simply don't believe in Titens ! But then, Titens are not real. Jesus IS real. We all were hard wired with a thirst for God. We may deny it and we may suppress it but, it is still real and still there. If it isn't real, why does it bother these people so much ?

<P><LI>The people group known as Jews have been with us as a distinct group for thousands of years. When we first hear of them in the Bible, there where lots of other people groups around them. 

<P>Gen 12:1-3 Says <B>"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."</B>

<P>There where lots of other people groups. Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Ammonites, Amalekites, Canaanites etc. Where are they now ? Only the Jews remain and we all know how hard the evil ones of the world have tried to wipe out the Jews.

<P><LI>Consider one other thing, or rather two. God said "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee:" You tell me. Have the nations that have hurt the Jewish people prospered ? Have the ones that have bleed the Jews prospered ? All the old enemies of the Jews from the Old Testament days are gone. The Spanish had the inquisition. Are they a world power today ? The Germans ? The Russians ? England was a major world power, backed a Jewish state after World War Two and then abandoned the Jews in Israel. Are they truly a world power today ? Since the beginning of the state of Israel the USA has been their friend. I live in the US and I can't believe how rich this country is. 

<P>Maybe you will disagree with me on this and that is your right, but if you study history you must admit, it's a good idea to treat the Jewish people right.
