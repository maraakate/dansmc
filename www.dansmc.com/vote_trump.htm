<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> You know, if the Fraudster-in-Chief <img class="expando cat" border="0" src="biden4.gif" width="15" height="20"> and his dud, Progressive, Democ<B>RAT</B> buddies had just continued with Trump's winning polices gas prices would be $1.70, the border would be secure, Wuhan virus cases would be down, The Afghan war would be ending peacefully and correctly. He could have taken credit for it all, even though it was all Trump's polices. He could have, he could have, yes, he could have. However, he did not because the Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B>, as President Ronald Regan said, know so many things that are not true. The Afghan disaster is only one example of the exceedingly poor leadership of the Fraudster-in-Chief.

<P> If you voted for loser Biden and other Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B> it is OK. That is all behind us now. Learn from your mistakes and vote for freedom and America next election. Check out the candidates, do your homework and vote for people who will put America first.

<P>One last thing. The most important thing. We are printing money like crazy. With each extra printed dollar the value of your dollars goes down. That is called <B>INFLATION</B>. To pay for healthy workers sitting at home playing video games. To pay for food stamps, health care, housing and everything else for ILLEGAL aliens, Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B> are giving away <B>YOUR</B> Citizenship Rights. <B>YOUR</B> Health Care and everything else that makes being a Citizen of the United States desirable, is being given to people who do not deserve it.

<P>What's that you say. The rich can pay for it? To the rest of the people in the world <B>YOU</B> are the rich. The Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B> are giving away <B>YOUR</B> I-Phone, <B>YOUR</B> car, <B>YOUR</B> food, <B>YOUR</B> housing, <B>YOUR</B> Health Care and everything <B>YOU</B> own to the poor of the world. Do the math. World Population
 7.8 billion. USA Population 333 Million. The US has 4.2% of the world's population. Who's the rich person now? <B>YOU!</B> Soon <B>YOU</B> will be a citizen of the world and baby, will <B>YOU</B> be <B>POOR.</B> Ah, make the rich pay. Don't believe me? Just look at our southern boarder.

<P>Do you want that? Keep voting for Progressive Democ<B>RATS</B> and you will get it.
