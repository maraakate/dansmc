<center><H1>Why I Do It</H1></center>


<font size=5><B>&#182;</B></font><font size=4 face=tahoma> It occurred to me that some people might want to know why I do this. As you might notice I don't require you to sign up for anything or charge anything. If I can, I will answer your motorcycle questions for free. I send out a free CD in appreciation for a $50 donation but you could just download everything and have the same thing and it would be free. I don't do it for money. No money in free stuff. I don't do it for the prestige. No prestige or power in free stuff. Not much sex either. I used to get all kinds of E-mail saying Hot Girls wanted me. They said they saw my profile online. I have only two questions. One, what is an online profile? Two, why don't these hot girls E-mail me any more? Maybe they found out I was married, you think? 

<P>Anyway, the question still remains. So why do I do it?

<P>I have a friend who told me he once handed out free socks to homeless people. He said it just made him feel wonderful inside. Alas, handing out free stuff does not do a thing for me. Sorry.

<P>Some people seem to get a charge out of handing out information. At one time I had a Bulletin Board on the site. I was not there other then to make sure the language stayed clean. Other then that I did not participate. Yet on at least two occasions a gentleman started answering all the questions people posted. Each guy stayed about a year and answered all the questions. Their answers where actually pretty good, so I left everything up. However, Why? Some people just feel compelled to give advice. I never really understood why. Me? No. 

<P>Now my E-mail link is on almost every page. You just have to look closely. If you have read the page and studied it, odds are you will have found the answer to your question AND the E-mail Link. If you are quick, sloppy and lazy odds are you will not. If you are that lazy and sloppy maybe you need to think twice about twisting wrenches on your bike. Sorry to offend but... just saying! However, if no one E-mails a question, that is fine with me. Less work for me. What, you still can't find it? Still doubt me? Bottom of page, center, long thin box with "Go to...." in it. Click the arrow on right, click "E-mail To Me", click "Go".

<P>Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s, at the Daytona Beach road race I read of an old man who worked for one of the spark plug companies. He was there each year all week long. His company paid him to be there where he would read spark plugs for the racers. Apparently he was VERY good at it. He would look at the spark plug, ask about jetting and timing and tell the racer to go to a bigger main jet or lower the jet needle or back off on the timing a degree or two or whatever. If the racer obeyed and took his advice, his bike would run better. 

<P>However, sometimes he would give advice and the racer would ignore it, then come back later with a bad running bike and a plug in worse condition. He would ask again and if the racer had not followed his detailed instructions he would just agree with whatever the racer said he wanted to do and send the racer on his way. If you did not listen to what he said the first time why waste words on a second time. I agree with him. If you do not listen to me the first time I feel no urge to tell you more.

<P>One guy said that I was a good person to do this but then he does not know me. He was wrong but enough said about that.

<P>So why do I do it? I do have a reason, you know.

<P>The only reason a lot of poor folks, in the poor countries of the world, get any kind of health care is that Missionaries come into the areas where they live and give it to them for free. The reason they give this free health care is to earn the right to tell the people about Jesus Christ. Why? Because Jesus saves. Jesus said in Matthew 11:28:

<P><B> "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</B>

<P>The Bible tells us in Psalms 34:8 

<P><B>"O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him."</B>

<P>Jesus is good. I have tasted his words and they are good. His words have blessed me. Following his words is good. So sue me. I like good things. I'll bet you like good things too. One of the good things that Jesus gives us is the one thing all governments and people in "Authority" are afraid for us to have. 

<Center>The "Man" does not want us to have <font size=5><B>freedom</B></font>. Never has.</Center> 

<P>Want proof? Can you say Obama Care? You are Forced to have Health Insurance. No Freedom there. I am sure you can think of lots more examples on your own.

<P>Jesus points out to us in John 8:31-2:

<P><B>"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."</B>

<P>and in John 8:36 

<P><B>"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."</b>

<P>Why does Jesus love us? I sure don't know. Why do you love the people you love? I find in Isaiah 55:1: 

<P><B>"<a href="ho.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=476,height=224,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;">Ho</A>, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."</B>

<P>Later in that same chapter verses 8-13:

<P><B>" For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.
 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
 <P>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

<P> So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
 <P>For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."</B>

<P>I'm glad Jesus loves you and me. I'm glad his thoughts are higher then mine. Those thoughts sound real good to me.




<P>So, in an effort to earn the right to tell you about Jesus I present to you my Motorcycle Repair Course. 

<P>No matter what problem we encounter during our trip through life, Jesus is the answer. Some may disagree with me. That is perfectly all right. Many Christians feel they just MUST get you saved. Trouble is "They" do not save you. Jesus saves you. No one else can. Some people pray to saints and prophets and seers for salvation. It doesn't work. They can't even save themselves, let alone you. Only one person can give you salvation. That person is Jesus.

<P>I don't tell you about Jesus to earn my salvation. Jesus has already given me that and he keeps my salvation safe so I cannot loose it. If someone I tell ends up believing in Jesus it does not increase my reward. If someone I tell about Jesus does not believe in him, it does not lessen my reward. I love Jesus and believe and trust him for all things.

<P>So why do I want to tell others about Jesus? When Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well he dealt loving with her to her benefit (John 4:7-36). His disciples marvelled that he talked with the woman and wanted him to eat. <B>"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."</B> and 
 <B>"My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."</B> It was Jesus' desire and his sustenance to do the work that God wanted him to do. It is my desire and sustenance to do the will of Jesus and Jesus wants me to tell you about Him. In fact, the only reason believers are here on earth is to tell non believers about the Salvation, Abundant Life and Freedom that belief in Jesus Christ brings.



<P>Jesus loves you. Do I love you? Well, not so much, BUT I am working on it! Jesus loves you and he has made it very clear in his word, the Bible, that I am supposed to love you too. OK, I will, if I have to, I guess. Like I said. I'm working on it. You know, it would really help if you were a bit more lovable too. So maybe we both need to work on it. Thing is, as long as I tell you and keep telling you whenever I can about Jesus. Well, I have done my job.

<P>And so my friends, that is why I do it.

<P>I like running reverse searches for my web site on Google. A reverse search shows who is linking to me or has commented on my web site. Interesting, I still can't find that online profile. There are indeed some who like my site but think I might be a little bit in your face religiously. Really? You have got to be kidding. I just figured out the total number of words on the <a href="acid.htm" target="_blank">Acid page.</A> I compared that total to the total number of words on that page of a religious nature, like a Bible verse on the page. The percentage of Bible words on that page compared to just motorcycle repair words is .01 %. On the <a href="buzzbox.htm" target="_blank">Buzz Box page</A> it is .04 %. Comparing the whole course of 144 pages to one page on the Bible you get about .007 %. So less the one half of one percent is in your face? I say again, Really?
 
<P><a href="protest_too_much.gif" style="text-decoration: none;" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow', 'width=986,height=339,scrollbars,resizable'); return false;"><font color=black>"Methinks they doth protest too much."</font></A> If, as the atheists say, God does not exist why does one half of one percent bother them so much? If a Muslim wrote a web site with information I needed and only mentioned Islam one percent of the time it would not bother me at all. Shoot, he could go ten percent and it would not bother me. So why does it bother them? Could it be Jehovah God is tapping them on the shoulder?

<P><B>"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."</B> John 14:6

<P> Jesus is the way. <font size=5><B>NO</B></font> other way works. I will repeat that, <font size=5><B>NO</B></font> other way works. Heavy duty words. 

<P>Jesus said in the book of John chapter 3, verses 16-18:

<P><B>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

<P>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</B>


<P>If you wish to reject Jesus consider his words in Matthew 25:31-46

<P><B>"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

<P>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

<P>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.


<P>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, <U><font color=red>prepared for the devil and his angels:</font></U>
 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

<P>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."</B>

<P>It is your choice. If you make a choice I disagree with I will not hurt you and neither will God. You have all your life to make your choice. That is why I will not blow you up or try to kill you if you make a choice I disagree with, unlike others I can think of. 

<P>In fact, if I can, I will do good things to you and for you. Jesus will too.

However, sooner or later we all have to die. Trouble is, we do not know when we will die. Then our choice will be set in stone. Hebrews 9:27 tells us:

<P><B>"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"</B>


<P>If you choose to reject Jesus and his free gift of eternall life, God will then honor your choice. In other words, if you end up in Hell it is because... 

<center><font size=5><B><U>You chose to go to Hell of your own free will.</U> 

<P>Choose Wisely.</font></B></center>

<center><Font size=5 color=red><B>Like I always say. If you Don't, It's OK. I don't care.<BR> It's your body and your soul that will be frying in Hell<BR>and it will not hurt me at all!</B></font>
<BR><BR>(Oops, wrong. Your body is a gift from God and you chose to reject God so<BR> no real body for you dude or dudette as the case may be.)<BR> </center>
